The great thing about pizza is that you can top it with vegetables, meats, condiments, or whatever sounds good.\nI agree totally. When I used to work at a local pizza place as a delivery driver, we used to experiment with different toppings. One of my favorites was a custom Philly Cheesesteak type pizza.\nWow. I know about the cheesesteak sandwich with steak and cheese in a roll. I need to try that on a pizza!\nIt is pretty good. But hey, there are many different types of toppings that go great on pizza. I believe the thing that separates the New York style from other styles, in my opinion, is the thin, foldable crust though."}

We could harvest a rib, then let them regrow it, and we'd have infinite ribs to eat without having to kill an animal haha.\nThat's so interesting ;) Did you know Patrick Stewart teaches master classes for drama students in the UK?\nI didn't know that. I like him; he's bald like me :). I think it's screwy Roger Deakins was nominated 13 times for best cinematography and has never won; they owe that guy a lifetime achievement Oscar at some point.\nI'm bald too! :) Lol. Hmm... I would have to Google the guy :) not recognizing the name...\nIt's pretty crazy that Hugh Laurie is the highest-paid actor ever by getting $700,000 per episode in House. I would have thought that the cast of Seinfeld or some other show was paid more per episode, but maybe they aren't taking inflation into account.\nI'm not sure about inflation, but I loved House, and I think he earned every penny :) He created an unforgettable character of Dr. House :)"}

It's widely considered to be a bad movie and was directed by Michael Bay. Have you watched it?\nNo, I have not, but people told me it was good.\nIt varies based on your foundation with Transformers. It's based on the '80s cartoon, so if you're watching from that perspective, many don't like it. Others who have never seen the cartoon before the movies like it.

For what it's worth, tacos too.\nI love to read as well. I have a mini library in my home. Who is your favorite author?\nThat's great, reading opens up a whole world.

The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel at 160 mph...\nNot sure I want to go 160 mph in a yellow bus with a cranky Dutch man at the wheel. My favorite mode is a motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, back at work in one week.\nThat does sound nice! I agree though, 160 mph is too fast. I prefer cars. In Iceland, there is no public rail system, and people often fly between cities. I'm not a fan of flight.\nI don't understand Japan. That is easy to say. $300 to travel across the country.

Back in Greek comedy, they used a dramatic performance that pits two groups against each other in an amusing conflict. That describes most SNL skits to a T.\nYeah, especially when they would use satire to portray people or institutions as absurd or corrupt. Something we can still relate to!\nAbsolutely. Also, most of those opposing sides were the \"Society of Youth\" versus the \"Society of the Old.\" That characterizes the comedy struggle between powerless young people against social conventions we now call \"The Man.\"\nTotally. I like that you can still listen to comedy on the radio.\nI agree. Also, comedy is even incorporated in our technology.

What year are you looking into?\nProbably one that is 5-6 years old - it was first introduced in 1972, so it's been around a long time.\nThat is a while; that is why they are so successful. They are a well-known manufacturer that knows about cars and how to upgrade and sell, etc.\nSome of the later versions of the Civic have even become known for their performance and sportiness - we have a Pilot, and it's so dependable."}

I'm sure Michael Caine would agree.\nMichael Caine knew what was what. I'm not sure that I agree with Jim Carrey's thinking about drama.\nYeah. All positive all the time isn't something to aim for.\nDrama can have positive outcomes, and comedy often comes at the expense of others.\nCountry music sometimes comes at the expense of others. There are only 2 African Americans in the country music Hall of Fame.\nCountry certainly hasn't been the genre for African Americans.

The tension can also change things as well.\nWhat kind of wood is typically used to make a violin?\nI am actually not sure, but the body of the violin is completely hollow.\nHow much does it usually cost to have strings put on a violin?\nPrices vary depending on the company, but you could also pay to have other parts such as the tuning pegs, tailgut, endpin, or chinrest repaired as well."}

I also like teaching as a passion, too! Kindergarten, to be specific.\nAh, that is very cool. Kindergarten was my favorite grade in school. How long have you been teaching?\nIt's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started!

That must be a handy tool for horror movie creators.", "That's super interesting. I wonder if any other sounds have strong emotional effects on us.", "A sound frequency that causes fear? That's both terrifying and cool. Could be why some movies give me chills.", "Is that sound theory why sometimes I feel anxious for no reason in horror movies? The power of audio, right?", "That's wild! So we're basically hardwired to react to certain sounds. Nature\u2019s own horror soundtrack, huh?", "A frequency that causes fear makes sense. It must be instinctual, like how certain noises make you want to run or hide."], "context": "I love horror movies. Do you watch them?\nI have seen some of them. I read somewhere that Stephen King was terrified as a child when he saw the movie Bambi.\nI can see that old Disney movies can be traumatic. Do you like Stephen King's work?\nI have seen some of them, and yes, they are quite scary at times. I read something funny that watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories.\nI must burn a lot of calories then, haha. Did you know that in The Shining, the kid who played Danny did not know they were filming a horror movie?\nWell, that is probably a good thing. I always wonder about the kids that are in horror movies. I also read that if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art, you will enjoy the art more. I wonder why?\nI also am curious as to why that would be. Have you ever heard of a waterphone?\nIsn't it what makes the creepy type noises in sci-fi or horror movies?\nIt is. It makes that jarring metallic noise.\nThis is totally off subject, but I just saw something interesting. There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans."}

Do you have any advice that can help me out?\nNot a lot, I'm afraid. :( Do you have any idea what the cause is? Was there a lack of independence or a personality clash or anything you can try to adjust?\nI think it has a lot to do with our personalities clashing, actually, so that might be something I did wrong. How much does it generally cost for a divorce?\nIt can vary a lot, depending on if there's a child involved, if you have to do child support, and how the distribution of property and debt will work.\nOh yeah, never thought about that. What percentage of people in the US get divorced, anyways?\nI think I've read somewhere that it's like 50%, though that includes second and beyond marriages.

What instrument do you play?\nI don't play anything well. Took violin lessons in elementary school.\nI tried learning how to play the violin and I'm just not good at it. I gave up.

I'm not sure I like the way delegates are used.\nI feel like there has to be a way to get more voters out. It hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.\nYeah, there's a lot of apathy. Funny, since 1900, the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time.\nThe president has been a member of either the Republican or Democratic party since 1853. I think we need more choices.\nOr maybe no parties at all. The left always accuses the GOP of being racist, but they were founded upon being anti-slavery.\nYeah, it's funny how silly committing to a party is.

It's like being transported back in time to another era.\nOh, that sounds neat. How long have people been doing that?\nI'm not sure, but some Renaissance fairs are permanent theme parks, while others are short-term events in a fairground, winery, or other large public or private spaces."}

Would you say it's a love story?\nSome look at it as the Japanese version of Romeo and Juliet, and in that regard, it is romantic. However, there is more to the story; his father denounces him, and he becomes an imperial officer. It portrays his internal agony in the latter half of the story.\nThat sounds really good. I definitely want to read it now. Can the book be found in my local library?\nIt would not be in a modern novel format. It is embedded in a compilation of stories in an old Japanese book; the name has something to do with Illusions if I remember correctly.\nThe more we keep talking about this story, I actually do think I have read some of this before. It has been a while, though. Does it end tragically or happily?\nIt does not have a typical plot.

My dog is always a source of entertainment like that.\nPets are important, and I'd go crazy without them. Glad you have a dog! One dog, three cats.\nWow, that's a lot of pets. Do they all get along with each other? My dog is definitely a loner pet and is best with only people.\nEvery animal definitely has a different personality. The dog is a guardian, friend, and peacemaker. The cats, generally, yes."}

How do you think digital media compares to novels?"], "context": "Hi there! Hanging out today. Just got back from getting groceries. Love listening to music when I drive. Love hip-hop. It's hard to believe it has been around since the late '70s!\nAwesome, I love hip-hop too. Hip-hop music has the largest vocabulary of any popular genre of music.\nYes, it does. In 2005, McDonald's paid hip-hop artists when they mentioned Big Macs in their songs.\nThat is very smart of McDonald's and good publicity. Muhammad Ali was actually regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of hip-hop.\nI didn't know that. Was that before he was a boxer?\nI would guess it was during, although I'm not sure. The band Vanilla Ice, who sang \"Ice Ice Baby,\" was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts.\nI used to love that one. France is the second-largest hip-hop market in the world.\nOh, really? That is surprising! It is commonly argued as to whether hip-hop started in the South or West Bronx. I think just saying it originated in the Bronx is good enough.\nI am sure. So, I also like to read in addition to listening to music. Did you know that in the 18th century, there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?\nWow, I would like to learn more about that. Reading is very powerful though; it promotes deep exploration of text during interpretation."}

I love the pandas in China. I want to visit one day.\nYou should! I've only been once, but it's an incredible experience!\nI'm slightly nervous about going. I'm a vegetarian and not sure about the food choices in China.\nIt definitely limits your choices, but no differently than how it limits your choices here. Meat or no meat, it will be an adjustment to eat foreign foods."}

That makes sense, considering the amount of stuff on there.\nI wouldn't expect it to be that big as a search engine. I'm sure Google is number one, but I would have expected number two to be maybe Yahoo or something similar.\nTrue. Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" is the most disliked video on YouTube. Do people dislike the video, or him?\nI'm not sure. It is awful, but there are such horrible musical performances on YouTube that I would not expect it to be number one.\nThat would probably be Psy's \"Gangnam Style.\" It got so many views on YouTube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.\nWow! That's pretty terrible also. Were you aware that YouTube and Netflix combined make up half the peak internet traffic in North America?"}

Do other religions sing?\nI'm not sure, but it is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking.\nOh, I see. What else can you tell me about religious music?\nBuddhist music is music for Buddhist ceremony or meditation.\nI wonder what that sounds like. I have only heard Christian music.\nThe Christian music industry is a small part of the larger music industry, so religious music is not that popular other than with religious people."}

Frankly, I know like only three phobias and I am out. Lol.\nYeah, I'm no expert on phobia names either, if I'm honest. Snakes are scary but they can be cool pets.\nYeah, there are some really cool ones, but I wonder how people have Burmese pythons as pets. Those things grow really HUGE!!!\nI heard the bigger the snake, the more attractive you are to women. Me, myself, I don't have that problem anyway.\nWhoa!

Fox actually considered making a cable channel of just that show!\nBut they also threatened to sue The Simpsons so that The Simpsons wouldn't parody its anti-democratic party agenda. I guess it's a love-hate relationship.\nThat is funny. Fox News was created by a Republican media strategist and Nixon, so that's probably not a surprise.\nIt's super popular too, watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.\nYeah, that is pretty nuts.

It was a nice place to enjoy a lot. It comprises 5 boroughs, which meet the Atlantic Ocean.\nI have heard that the population of New York City has reached 8.5 million. That is a lot of people.\nThe Empire State Building remains one of the iconic sites of the city.\nThat is pretty cool. I like how fast-paced New York City is.

Is it Trump with his real estate empire, or someone from earlier history?", "I've never thought much about the presidents' wealth.

Wealth across eras is hard to compare, but it's safe to say that real estate and inheritance played key roles for Washington and Jefferson.

Combine land, slaves, and inflation\u2014he might top the list, followed closely by modern magnates like Trump.", "Hmm, I think it's tricky with inflation, but historically, George Washington was huge on landowning. Jefferson had Monticello. In the recent era, Trump's fortune is quite notable.", "I know that presidential wealth varies greatly, and inheritance, like with Kennedy, and self-made fortunes like Trump's, both tilt the scale. Washington's vast estates probably put him high on that list, too.", "If we're counting inflation-adjusted assets, George Washington might lead due to his landholdings.

One part is also Christianity. Did you hear about Thomas Jefferson creating his own Bible?\nYeah, I guess he did not like this version, so he cut out the supernatural parts of it.\nYeah, that's kind of weird. Did you hear about the Tower of Babel? You know the history of it, apparently it is based on a real building.\nSeems like it is, it is somewhere in modern-day Iraq. That is pretty cool.\nThat is cool that the idea of the Tower of Babel was based on a real thing. What are your thoughts on Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams? Apparently, they're the only two presidents that did not swear in with a Bible.\nWell, if they are not religious, then they are free to do that. Do you know why the fruit apple got that name?\nI think it's because when the Bible was translated, they used the word that could translate into both apple and evil. And that is how it became the fruit in the Garden of Eden, am I right?\nYup, that is exactly it. Switching topics, do you know who the three wealthiest US presidents are?"}

If there's enough fan support, the NBA would consider it.", "I've been following the Raptors, great to see them doing well. It speaks volumes about the potential in Canadian markets. Maybe Vancouver or Montreal next?", "Best record, that's exciting! It's surprising we haven't seen a new Canadian team after the Grizzlies moved. Seems overdue with basketball growing globally."]}

To us the sun is so big. Imagine it has a diameter that is 109 times the diameter of the earth!\nThat is just too crazy, did you know the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet all the energy needs of the whole world for 500,000 years?\nThose are all big numbers! I was amazed also to learn that a lightening bolt is five times hotter than the surface of the sun\nThat is truly amazing, and what really is, is that people get hit with those things and still survive somehow!\nWe can, but we can't stare at the sun! Thank god we have the athmosphere to protect us. And this also gives a color effect, makes the sun look yellow!", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the atmosphere acts like a filter. By the way, have you ever wondered what solar storms could do to our technology if not for our protective magnetic field?", "It's pretty incredible, isn't it? The sun's yellow hue is just due to our atmosphere scattering light. Out in space, the sun would actually look white!", "True! And in some cultures, the sun is actually worshipped as a god because of its immense power and life-giving energy. Quite fascinating!", "Speaking of the atmosphere, it's worrying how human activities are affecting it. Climate change could alter so much, including how we view the sun. We must protect our planet."]}

The keyboards are constructed in a v shape to allow a more natural angle.\nI could probably use one of those once I got past the learning curve.

Especially if your constantly typing.\nI prefer to stand up and stretch or move often when I am working at my desk; I find that it helps with muscle strain.\nThat's a smart thing to do.

Take your time to find what works for you.", "You might want to check out some online reviews or forums for advice on the best ergonomic keyboard for transcription work.", "That's a good plan.

I like the Lakers, but can't believe granny style is the absolute best technique to consistenly score points according to physicists, I wonder why they don't employ that style of shooting?\nProbably because it takes a long time to wind up.

But it's interesting how even embassies use it to show a softer, more approachable image.", "Sometimes, I wonder if those kinds of posts downplay the seriousness of international relations, or maybe it's a strategic move to seem relatable.", "You're probably right, it's just social media after all. But it's also a powerful tool for public diplomacy and shaping narratives, isn't it?"]}

It is one of the biggest parts of business management though, along with innovaton.\nWhat is innovation?\nInnovation is the realization of new ideas, methods, or devices.\nWow that is great.

Do you know jimcarrey?\nHe's a good comedian, I'm not so much into his dramas though.\nHe does not make them anymore though because they do not have a positive outcome\nInteresting, I haven't seen him in anything in a long time. Did you know that Patrick Stewart teaches masters classes?", "candidates": ["Really? That's fascinating! Love Patrick Stewart. I believe such classes must be incredibly insightful given his Shakespearean background and success in film.", "Oh, that's news to me! A masterclass with Stewart would be amazing. He's such a versatile actor, from Star Trek to X-Men.", "I didn't know that. Learning from Patrick Stewart must be a dream for aspiring actors. His work on stage and screen is legendary.", "That's cool! Patrick Stewart is an acting legend. His students are lucky to learn from such a well-respected figure in the industry."]}

We're looking forward to exploring the local culture and art scene. Portland has such a vibrant community.", "Indeed! We're excited about the change, especially with Portland's reputation for great food. Ever tried any restaurants here?", "It is!

What kind of dogs do yo have?\nA boston terrier and a chihuhua cross.\nAw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash?\nMost of the time, until we see another dog.", "candidates": ["Ah, typical dog behavior. Have you ever considered training or socializing them more to help with that?", "Haha, every dog's Achilles' heel! Do they get super excited or are they a bit defensive around other pups?", "That sounds challenging. Have you tried using distraction techniques with treats or toys when another dog appears?", "Oh, I can imagine! Is it difficult to manage both when another dog comes into the picture?"]}
{"context": "I have always wanted to be tall but everyone in my family is vertically challenged! Lol\nIt seems a lot of people value height nowadays, specifically in guys, if you are under 6 foot you arent good enough\nIt's the same thing with women! I'm only 5'5 and considered very short by women's standards today.\nHuman height is a weird thing, simply distance from the ground determines self worth, but dont worry avergae height for women is 5'3\nWhat is the average height for males?\nThe standard human height in males when standing upright is 5'10 roughly, quite the differnce\nIt's funny how something as silly as height becomes so significant in how we view others! Lol", "candidates": ["Absolutely, appearance plays such a big role in perception. Have you noticed industries like fashion or entertainment promoting a certain height ideal?", "True, it's odd. Personality and talents are so much more important, don't you think?", "That's society for you! I reckon confidence matters more than height, though. You can't measure presence in inches!", "It's human nature to have preferences, but in the end, how we treat each other makes the real difference, not our height."]}

Are you planning to try one of those mega-sized breakfasts?\"", "Las Vegas is definitely a foodie's paradise. Have you found any restaurants that you're particularly excited about?", "I've heard about those! Some of the food portions are outrageous.

Curious choice, though, any particular reason?", "That's quite sophisticated for a first word! Is there a backstory on why he said that?", "Oh my! That's unexpected for a first word. How did he come to say Josef Stalin?"]}
{"context": "I love orange juice!\nI agree! There's many kinds of course, including blood orange, navel, and even tangerine!\nBlood oranges are delicious! I've always wondered how many oranges it takes to full a carton of orange juice.\nMe too, probably a bunch! The skins are pretty tough and can be hard to peel. Worth it, though!\nThey really are. Makes you wonder how someone even thought to try eating them in the first place.", "candidates": ["Right? Humans have been eating oranges since ancient times. Someone must've been really curious to discover that tough-looking fruit was so tasty and juicy on the inside.", "Necessity is the mother of invention, they say. Hunger can lead to some pretty amazing discoveries\u2014I guess oranges are one of them!", "I've read that trade routes spread different fruits around. Maybe a traveler or trader saw the potential in those oranges.", "Indeed, it's fascinating! Just think, without that curious individual, we might not be enjoying orange juice today."]}

What grade do you teach?\nHigh school chemistry.\nOoh that sounds rough", "candidates": ["It has its moments, but I do love when a student's eyes light up finally understanding the periodic table.", "It can be tough, but it's rewarding when they grasp complex concepts\u2014it's those small victories that keep me going.", "Definitely challenging. Teenagers can be a handful with their energy, but it's interesting to find ways to engage them in science.", "Yes, it's demanding, but I'm always looking for new ways to spark their interest in chemistry.

Do you?\nYes, I especially enjoyed Lady Gaga's performance in the movie \"A Star is Born\", but what I like even more is James Corden and Alicia Keys remake of the lyrics on the song \"Shallow\" on his comedy show.\nI love Lady Gaga. She seems so nice. Elton John named her his son's godmother.\nThat's pretty neat, I wonder what kind of gifts or treatment being the godson of Lady Gaga gets especially when she's had so many successful singles from \"Poker Face\" to \"Bad Romance\" to \"Just Dance\", I'm familiar with all of them!\nWhen ever Poker Face comes on the radio, my son asks me \"How do you wake up Lady Gaga? Poker Face! HAHAHA!\" Gets me everytime!", "candidates": ["Haha, that's a classic joke! Kids have the best sense of humor. Does your son enjoy her music as much as we do?", "That's hilarious! It's amazing how songs like \"Poker Face\" become a part of our everyday lives, even in jokes.", "Your son's joke is adorable! Lady Gaga's music really spans all ages.

Can you report it to someone?\nI have a team leader who I can try to report it to but he always seems to brush me off. It's getting old at this point!", "candidates": ["Maybe it's time for written evidence. Can you log the incidents and present a pattern to your supervisor higher up than the team leader?", "That's tough. Have you considered talking directly to your coworker about how his leaving affects you?", "Have you looked into your company's HR policies? They might have a formal grievance procedure for situations like this.", "It sounds exhausting. Self-care is important too. Do you think finding a way to de-stress after such days could help you cope?"]}
{"context": "I love pets,dogs,cats etc.pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment rather than as a working animal,\nWhat's your favorite pet?\nThe domestic dog, the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore\nWhy are they human friendly hence the use of pets?\nPets can give companionship to elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people\nWhat other notable stuff do they do?\nInterestingly,there are proof that they help humans recover from illness,especiallyare brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes.", "candidates": ["That's incredible! How exactly do therapy dogs help people recover faster?", "Beyond therapy, do pets also contribute to improving mental health in general?", "That's fascinating.

It's fun and aligns with the whole health-conscious vibe of a smoothie shop.", "Honestly, I enjoy comfort foods like burgers and fries, but I've been getting into salads and wraps lately. They'd be a fresh addition to a smoothie place."]}

He has to be up there though.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, Trump's wealth is definitely notable, but George Washington, with his land holdings adjusted for inflation, often tops the list of wealthiest presidents.", "Sure, he is. However, it's interesting to consider that wealth from historical figures like George Washington could exceed Trump's when adjusted for today's values.", "Yeah, Trump's rich, but some past presidents, like Washington and Jefferson, had vast estates that, inflation-adjusted, could outvalue him.", "Indeed, he's wealthy, yet if you adjust for inflation, presidents like George Washington had far more, largely due to massive landholdings at the time."]}

Maybe a YouTube channel?\nPossibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News.\nOh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm.\nYea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.\nI believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe.\nYep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased.", "candidates": ["It's important to have diverse news sources. I try to check multiple outlets to get a more complete picture of what's going on.", "Bias is everywhere, unfortunately. It's challenging to find completely neutral news these days.", "I've noticed that many news sources have some level of bias. It takes effort to sift through and find the facts.", "Each channel has its angle, indeed. Maybe that\u2019s why people like to cross-reference news with independent fact-checkers or international media."]}

What breed of dog do you have?\nShe is a pitbull hound mix. She is getting older so I think I'm going to geta 2nd dog soon.\nWe have a beagle so they're kind of related I suppose.

With the emergence of new technology and platforms, the 2020s will undoubtedly have its own pop flavor that might distinguish it enough for a subgenre.", "Could be.

Plus most the games are not that interesting. I try to watch the super bowl though.\nSame. I recently found out that the Nfl uses tracking chips on the players and the football.\nYes, the chips are there to help with injuries I believe. I guess it helps with strategy and tv viewing too.\nYeah something to do with speed, velocity, location and stuff.\nYes, that is true. Did you know that the eagles had a temporary court set up in their stadium for six years due to their fans bad behavior?\nLol thats hilarious. Maybe Oakland should get one of those.\nYeah, Oakland. I wonder if one court would be enough for a game.", "candidates": ["Seriously? A court for fans? That's so absurd it's almost genius. Makes you wonder about the justice system's role in sports.", "Wow, I didn't know that. Fans can really get that crazy? It's kind of sad but also a bit amusing.", "That's wild about the Eagles! Sports can ignite some intense passions. Safety first, I guess!", "Hah, a court is one way to handle things. I suppose it's an innovative solution to keeping rowdy fan behavior in check."]}

I had a nightlight to help.\nI slept in my mom's room because I was always afraid of the dark", "candidates": ["Wow, sleeping in your mom's room must've been comforting. Do you still feel uneasy in the dark sometimes?", "It seems we both found ways to cope. Have you managed to overcome that fear now?", "That's understandable, having someone close by makes it less scary. Are you more comfortable with it now?", "I think lots of kids go through that phase. Isn't it funny how we find safety in different ways?"]}

I think it'd be great for the team's morale and the fans would love it.", "Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion, but I'm curious, what's behind your hope for them not qualifying?", "That's an interesting take.

{"context": "Hi, I'm naturally very athletic so I want to train and become involved in Olympic weightlifting. Are you familiar with this Olympic sport?\nI am! My boyfriend was training as an Olympic weightlifter! The most important lifts to practice are the \"clean and jerk\" and the \"snatch.\" Those are the only two lifts in the Olympics.\nThat's great to know and very impressive. A lot of the component lifts involved are used by other athletes to train their strength as well.\nI think the hardest part is making such dynamic and explosive lifts look graceful! That takes a certain skill!\nI agree, mastering that turns it into an art. Olympic weightlifting is also controlled by the International Weightlifting Federation.\nI don't know about you, but I'm disappointed that the Olympics discontinued the \"clean and press\" lift. I guess it was hard for them to judge proper form.\nYes I feel the same. I think that change was first implemented in 1972.", "candidates": ["Definitely! The 'clean and press' was a classic. Now, to get started, you should probably find a good coach to make sure you learn the right techniques.", "True, it's been a while since they removed it. Do you have any local gyms in mind that specialize in Olympic weightlifting training?", "That's right, 1972. It's been all about the 'clean and jerk' and 'snatch' ever since. Have you watched any recent competitions for inspiration?", "It's a shame, but safety and judging consistency are key.

{"context": "Do you like comedy? Demetri Martin liked it so much that he left Harvard Law to pursue a career in it.\nHi, yes I like comedy a lot both stand up comediennes and the typical 30 minute TV comedy. I used to pass the time alot with them when I was in college. How about you? What kind of comedy do you like?\nI don't care for 3rd rock from the sun even though it won the best comedy series in 1997 over seinfeld, friends, and frasier. I prefer Seinfeld.\nOddly enough for me I absolutely loved Seinfeld - both Jerry and Kramer. I think that Jerry was a genius for that creation. I also kinda liked 3rd rock because I like John Lithgow a lot. I think that he is a polished and accomplished actor. French Stewart not so much. Could identify with any of these series either personal observation or experiences?\nI try to make light of situations and laugh but I do empathize with drama characters like Hugh Laurie the highest paid actor ever with $700,000 per episode", "candidates": ["Wow, that's impressive for Hugh Laurie! Have you ever watched 'House'? His performance is outstanding and it blends drama with bits of sarcastic humor.", "Seinfeld had such relatable humor! Do you have a favorite episode or character quirk that stands out for you?", "I respect that you're more into drama; sometimes the realness strikes a chord. Do you find comedy helps balance out the heavy themes in dramas you like?", "Hugh Laurie's salary is wild! Humor in the face of adversity is powerful.

I know he owned a lot of real estate.\nYeah, wealth came form the land in those times, now it comes from \"likes\" and subscribers. The president of Indonesia must have a lot of them, he released 3 albums.\nSpeaking of land, I see that 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the US government too.\nIt is a good thing or a bad thing? They did a lot of nuclear tests there, I would not buy this land.\nProbably a good thing then. It's funny that Wikileaks published a story that the US government wants to destroy Wikileaks.\nSo they leaked the plan to stop the leaks? Sometimes I think officials should be chosen by lottery, like in ancient Athens.", "candidates": ["The Athenian lottery system was quite a unique form of democracy. It's interesting to ponder how our politics would shift if we used a similar method today.", "Honestly, giving everyone an equal chance to govern through a lottery sounds pretty fair, considering how polarized things are nowadays.", "Ridiculous as it sounds, a lottery might not be the worst idea. Sometimes, random selection could beat out career politicians when it comes to fresh perspectives.", "A lottery could be a disaster or a fresh start. Ancient Athens had a simpler political landscape, but it'd sure shake up modern politics!"]}

They are the world's largest automotive segment since 2015, after all.\nWow, I had no idea! I bought it because of the four wheel drive - we get a lot of snow here!\nYes, the SUV's ruggedness, raised ground clearance, and four-wheel drive are part of their popularity.\nThe one I got is a Toyota, but I think there are other manufacturers that make them too, right?\nFor sure. Ford, for example, makes multiple SUVs, including their full-sized version, the Expedition.\nWhen were the SUVs first manufactured?\nI'm not sure when exactly, but over time the term SUV has come to replace terms like Jeep and Land Rover in popular lexicon.\nI love driving my SUV, but I do worry about roll overs if I take a corner too fast!", "candidates": ["Absolutely, it's important to be mindful of your speed, especially in corners. SUVs have a higher center of gravity, so cautious driving is key.", "Indeed, rollover risks are higher in SUVs. Always take turns slower than you would in a smaller car to stay safe.", "That's a valid concern. Many modern SUVs have stability control features to help prevent rollovers\u2014make sure to familiarize yourself with your vehicle's safety systems.", "Safety first, always.

That is just crazy.\nI would assume so, since the specific issue they were arguing about was whether southern slave owners could serve as missionaries.\nI did not know that. I wonder when they chose to change their stance on slavery. I wonder how many slave owners actually wanted to be missionaries.\nWell I believe since the 1940s the Southern Baptist Convention has tried to shift from some of its regional and historical identification, so I think they were fairly late to change their opinions.\nThat is really nuts.

It's interesting to see his evolution, both as an artist and as a person.", "Absolutely, using his platform to spread positivity can have a big impact.

Not everyone in Hollywood stays true to their beliefs, especially if it means turning down big roles.", "It's cool that he follows his heart. Sometimes it can be a risk, but Jim Carrey's talent lets him pick roles that align with his values."]}

Were they trying to make some kind of political statement with the squid-eating, or was it pure shock value?", "A live squid? That sounds inhumane. Do you think they'll face any backlash for that stunt?", "Eating a live squid is unheard of in a debate.

Willie Nelson has that timeless quality. Have you tried any indie country artists? They often have a more classic sound.", "That's fair; music evolves. But don't you think there are some new artists who capture that old-school vibe?", "Yeah, Willie's hard to beat. The genre's changed a lot, though. It's more pop-influenced now. Any particular 'new stuff' that turned you off?", "True, Willie is a legend. The new direction of country isn't for everyone. Maybe it's the storytelling you miss in the modern tunes?"]}

I sometimes add corn and avocado for extra flavor.", "Interesting, never thought to add mango.

It's a tough protein that helps form the structure of hair and guards against damage.", "Our hair strands are composed of keratin fibers, which grow from follicles located in our skin's dermal layer.", "Mostly keratin, a strong protein\u2014same stuff as in animal horns and hooves.

We still have a big inequality in US taxes in general. Income tax is measured before and after/\nI think taxation is one of the worst executed things in America.

A friend of mine produces one of the Amazon prime original series, so we are loyal viewers! Amazon CEO, Bezos, is a smart dude. Smehow he even managed to get the USPS to work on Sunday!\nYes, it was also prescient of him to buy IMDB in 1998 and end up being able to integrate it into its streaming service.\nHave you watched movies on the IMDB Freedive app yet? I feel a little guilty watching so much Amazon Fire TV, while Amazon employees in the warehouse are walking up to 15 miles per day working for us!\nI have not, is it any good?

Of course, I live in Texas, so we are a little short on mountains here... Freedive is good.

Maybe he'll go after the market for cars like Elon Musk did? There's a lot of room for tech in that industry.\nAs long as there are McDonalds drive thru windows, there will be a market for cars! McDs invented the drive thru to accomodate servicemen and women who were not allowed to exit their vehicles while wearing fatigues. I wonder why they invented the McNugget?", "candidates": ["That's fascinating about the drive-thru origin! As for the McNugget, was it for convenience, or maybe a way to make chicken more appealing for on-the-go eating?", "The McNugget probably started as an innovative way to use chicken scraps. Marketing them as bite-sized snacks must've been a hit for families and kids!", "I bet nuggets were a fast food game changer \u2013 quick to make and eat. They're iconic now, just like those drive-thrus. Everything evolves to suit faster lifestyles, huh?", "Inventing the McNugget might've been about taste and efficiency.

Their workers walk 7 to 15 miles a day thats is how busy they are", "candidates": ["Wow, that's a lot of walking.

I did some research on my home and it turns out there are no records of it being built. Now I am terrified.", "candidates": ["That's bizarre! Maybe check with the local historical society about your house's past, could be a clerical error or something more... mysterious.", "No records? Are you sure you looked in the right places? You might want to consult a professional historian or a real estate expert.", "That's really creepy. Have you considered installing security cameras? They could help you figure out if there's a logical reason for the noises you're hearing.", "I've heard of hauntings in unregistered homes before.

My three kids drink it too much though lol\nYeah, I keep saying I need to cut soda altogether.\nSame here, my doctor told me I have high cholesterol", "candidates": ["Wow, with high cholesterol, it's definitely good to consider healthier choices. Perhaps we can both find a way to quit together and keep each other accountable!", "High cholesterol is serious; maybe try switching to diet versions or water? It's tough but worth it for your health!", "That's rough, maybe start with reducing the kids' consumption, could be a good example for them and a step towards better health for you too.", "Have you tried those flavored waters? I've been thinking of swapping soda out for those, might help with the cholesterol and still satisfy the craving."]}

Otherwise, would they not eventually overrun other species?\nYou would think. Let's hope they are, or jelly fish will rule the world someday!\nAquatic species can be amazing. Did you know that 84% of genes for human disease have equivalents in the zebrafish?\nThat's pretty scary, Zebra fish are super invasive too I believe. Freshwater fish drink through their skin!\nI am not much on aquatic species other than to eat them. But a friend has a large saltwater aquarium. Did you know the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?\nThat's pretty crazy! The black swallower fish can eat prey twice it's size!

What about them?\nWell they mimic the sound of car alams, chainsaws and also cameras,\nOh, that sounds like the lyre birds. I guess I have heard of them. Birds are neat. The reason they can fly is thanks to their almost hollow skeleton.\nThat must be really funny to listen at lol, you know that birds have bones that are so hollow they can even weigh more than their feathers\nI believe it, especially when some of them are only two inches long. Can you imagine being so lightweight?", "candidates": ["Absolutely, it's like nature's own engineering marvel.

Not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes.\nOh I know, I just feel so bad that I behaved that way towards him.", "candidates": ["It's okay to feel that way, we all have moments of weakness. Maybe setting aside some time for self-care can help prevent irritability in the future.", "Have you thought of talking to him about it?

Keeping a mascot safe is no small task!", "Maybe they've got a specially trained 'Goat Squad' who handle all things Bill. It's like VIP protection for a four-legged celebrity.", "Could be the cadets themselves who take care of him.

Just simply restrict your carbohydrate consumption and it will fall off!\nI have tried that, I am a mother and I breastfeed my baby, so I tend to eat a lot", "candidates": ["I understand your situation. Perhaps a balanced diet with moderate exercise would be more suitable considering your breastfeeding. Have you considered consulting a nutritionist?", "Oh, breastfeeding can definitely increase your appetite! Maybe focus on nutrient-dense foods rather than cutting calories right now.", "That\u2019s tough, but it's important to eat well while breastfeeding.

I stunk up the courts I was so bad. The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days. Crazy.\nWas that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?\nI'm not sure. They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open. Bet that dried it fast.\nThat was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since\nWow. I didn't know that. Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players. Interesting.\nSo maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts?

Have you ever been to a live tennis match?", "Haha, true! Traditions in sports and fashion can be quite intertwined and surprising.

Romantic kissing is actually a recent development.\nThat surprises me, I guess I always associated it with all love stories. Even Shakespeare.\nYeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it.\nI see. Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature. I always though it was for peace\nInteresting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!\nSame here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.

Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel.", "candidates": ["Oh, that sounds hilarious! Do you know what it's called or how people participate?", "Worst opening sentence? That must be quite a creative challenge.

Makes our modern sports seem much more forgiving in comparison.", "Exile seems harsh! Did winners get any particular rewards or honors back then?", "Exiling the losers is tough.

So, were you really scared of the Easter bunny when you were little?", "Well, it sounds odd, but I took a nibble once and found I kind of liked them. Anyway, do you have pets as well?", "Oh, I was just joking about eating the dog biscuit. Still, it's funny what we end up trying out of curiosity, isn't it? What's the weirdest food you've tried?", "I didn't actually eat it\u2014it's a little joke I have with my pup. But have you ever tried any unusual snacks before, maybe something local from Alabama?"]}

How did you do it?\nI looked at the other student's paper. I was so ashamed.", "candidates": ["Your guilt is a sign of your conscience. It's important to find ways to improve honestly. Can you make it right, maybe by confessing or studying harder for the next one?", "Cheating is risky and unfair to others. Why don't you seek help instead of taking shortcuts?

Maybe some study groups or extra practice could help."]}

I never realized they owned IMDB. They're everywhere these days, it seems.", "Oh wow, they own IMDB too?

Helps with the frustration.", "A run would do me good, but I'd probably just end up at another car dealership, buying something to fill the void.", "I wish I could run off the stress.

I need to watch the Dune miniseries that came out since the Lynch movie.\nDo you know much about Marcia Lucas? She's George's wife and she made a lot of the changes that made the movies what they are. So much that her editing won her an Academy Award\nYeah, I've seen some speculation that it was her lack of influence over the prequels that made them so much worse.\nThat's an interesting theory. It's also pretty cool that it the first major film to be dubbed for Native Americans. They must love the movies too\nYeah, I'm surprised the studios would do that given the numbers -- maybe it was a crowdsourced/volunteer effort. I know Iceland has such a small population it's really hard to get movie translations, software versions, etc. In their language.\nMaybe it's worth it since it's the most successful film franchise\nYeah, I guess all the other outlay is just sunk costs, so they make back the cost of just dubbing in the language even if not many people watch it.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the passion the fans have probably makes it worth the investment for the studios, especially for such an iconic series.", "It's a form of cultural respect too, making it accessible to a wider audience beyond just the mainstream.", "Could also be a strategic move, ensuring the brand's longevity by engaging different communities directly.", "Yeah, and technology has made dubbing cheaper and easier than ever before, so language barriers are less of an issue now."]}

George rr martin despises fan fiction, saying that it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.\nWow, I never knew! I don't think I agree with him on it being a bad exercise though. Actors Jon Hamm and Patrick Stewart each were drama teachers at one point.\nNo I dont agree either.

{"context": "Sometimes I wonder if these celebrities use their big multi million companies and purchases for money laundering, which is I guess why Jay-Z might be being investigated.\nI find it weird though that they are trying to get information out of him with for something that no longer is under his control. Also, it is strange that he doesn't want to comply. Currently I do believe that it is the responsibility of the Iconix spokesperson to get his stuff worked out.\nYes, the fact that he won't even comment about whether or not he ever plans to address the subpoena makes him seem especially suspicious! If you had nothing to hide then no way would you want to risk being held in contempt of court.\nTrue. Also I think its crazy that law teachers teach from his song \"99 Problems\". Perhaps he knows more about the law than many think. He is very strategic and smart in the sense that he made it out of Brooklyn. I'm not sure if they could catch him. I think he thought all this through. Also its true that no one wears Rocawear anymore so It could be a dead business to him and something he thought logical to do.\nIt's bizarre to think that rap can end up being so significant in our culture. I have even heard that some of Tupac's music is in the library of congress due to it's cultural significance\nWow. I didn\u02bbt know that. I love rap. I do believe that everything is connected. I wonder if artist use entertainment as a way to express truths or if they use the truth of their experience to sell as entertainment. I definitely think they use whats relatable to control reactions and whatever in certain societies. Also that is crazy that Mcdonalds pays people to reference Big Macs. Now Nicki Minajs lyrics make sense.\nWell although some people like her must be trying to make money, I do think many people who love to entertain and dabble in storytelling, music, drama, dance, or other classic forms of performance do have to balance a bit of selling in order to fund their lifestyle.\nDefinitely. People have to make money to live. I think it is dangerous when it comes to a point where they can be perceived as vulnerable and honest but in fact they are just selling a product. Because they are in a way looked up to, they have the power to change things, but once you realize that and start to do it, you have the risk of losing it all. It\u02bbs a crazy cycle.\nYes, and it can be a bit of a burden almost that the modern entertainment industry has accelerated the process of creating entertainment so much. Even though it's good for entertainment pursuits to be available to more, it's not good that people who want to take advantage of the industry can make money exploiting people's emotions", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the exploitation is troubling. Consumers must stay vigilant about the authenticity of what they're being sold emotionally and artistically.", "True, the industry tempts exploitation, but it's the responsibility of artists to navigate this without compromising their integrity or their audience's trust.", "It's a double-edged sword. Fans crave connection, which artists can provide, but it's when commercialism overshadows authenticity that the art suffers.", "The line between art and exploitation often blurs. It's crucial for both artists and audiences to foster an environment where genuine talent is celebrated over manufactured sentiment."]}

No social media drama for it!", "It must just float around, doing jellyfish things. No need for conversations or celebrity gossip down there.", "Maybe it meditates on the mysteries of the ocean.

I had no idea, especially since it is such a garbage show honestly.\nYea Dancing with the Stars is very popular as a show though", "candidates": ["Well, popularity doesn't always equate to quality, I guess. It's interesting what people find entertaining.", "Yeah, I've seen some really popular shows that just aren't my cup of tea. To each their own!", "Perhaps I'm missing something in its appeal. It's fascinating how different our tastes can be.", "Guess it shows there's a market for everything, even if we're not part of it. What shows do you like?"]}

Do you specialize in any particular exercise or training regimen?", "That's awesome! I bet your weekends are filled with active adventures then? Any favorite workout spots you recommend?", "Nice!

Linebackers play on the defensive team, and line up around 3 to 5 years behind the line of scrimmage and behind the defensive linemen.\nI think you meant 3-5 yards! Linebackers are also very versatile and play an important role in pass protection when needed. Do you have a favorite linebacker?\nOops, you are correct haha. I do not have a favorite player, I just really like the position because their objective is to provide extra run protection or extra pass protection based on the defensive play being executed.

It's also impressive how linebackers need to read the offense quickly and react\u2014real field generals, don't you think?", "You're spot on about defense. So do you enjoy more when linebackers make a huge sack or when they skillfully break up a pass?", "Defense wins championships! Linebackers really are the heart of the defense.

{"context": "Hey there! Read anything interesting lately, I sure did! I read about a 19 year that developed a code for an AI to design portraits! Crazy to think someone so young could do that.\nThat is crazy! Do you know how the 19 year old did it?\nI'm not sure how exactly he did it, I guess if I did I'd make one as well! But I know he was only 17 and bored when he did it, he started off by feeding it rap lyrics so it could generate random rap songs. And than he fed it random portraits from the internet to teach it how to make art!\nThat is really impressive! So, did he get a job or a college invite for his talent/success?\nHe sure did! He's now working at the Stanford University AI Lab. He didn't seem to think anyone would pay much attention to his portraits, so much as sell something based on his work!\nI'm glad to hear that! So, how did the program work? What does the artwork look like?\nThe man in the portrait has no noise, people even say it can look like frosty the snowman! Mario Klingemann says it can't believe how much the portrait sold for, he thought it was terribly done even for an AI. And he would know being an AI Artist!\nI guess people bought it because of how it is done. How much did it sell for anyway?\nA French Art collective known as Obvious downloaded the code, and their AI portrait sold for 432,500! The auction house didn't seem to think it would go for so high!\nThat is amazing! Is it possible to tell if a human painted it or a computer?", "candidates": ["With current technology, it's getting harder to tell. Some AI art is so sophisticated that experts debate whether it's human-made or not.", "Experts can sometimes spot differences in brushwork or style, but AI is improving rapidly. Distinctions are blurring!", "It often takes a trained eye to see the subtle differences, but AI tends to have a certain 'perfect' quality that can be a giveaway.", "It can be tough to distinguish, but usually, AI-created works are too precise or lack the human touch you'd find in artistically brushed strokes."]}

I started thinning in my early 20's so I take it in stride. Is it treatable?\nMost treatments work best to slow down hair loss, rather than regrow hair. I refuse to wear a wig, though!\nAll I can say is embrace it. I shave my head.....it doesn't grow on top at all anymore. We all have flaws. I don't blame you at all for refusing a wig.\nThe Egyptians used a wig to shield their bald heads from the sun.

Besides his on-court brilliance, he's making a huge impact off-court too. It's inspiring!", "For sure, and it's athletes like him who use their platform responsibly that can really make a difference. It's about more than just basketball.", "Totally agree. Setting such an example is crucial. Makes you respect him beyond his athletic skills, right?", "Exactly, it shows he understands his influence. Generosity like that helps change lives and perceptions of athletes."]}

Did you call the police, or how are you handling it?", "What a nightmare situation! Have you spoken to your insurance company about what you can do next?", "Unbelievable... brand new and already in an accident because of someone else. Are you okay, though?", "That's just awful! I hope no one was hurt. Is there any way to hold her responsible without insurance?"]}
{"context": "Space creeps me out, the fear of the unknown is real.\nYeah but we have to understand the concept of space to understand the physical universe\nWhenever I think of space, I think of the black holes. Do you know what black holes are?\nNo but many of these questions were discussed during the renaissance\nWow, that's interesting for sure. How did they observe space during the renaissance?\nThey discussed it in relation to classical mechanics which is odd to me\nDo you believe in aliens in space? Or life in space?\nI do, debates concerning space date back to antiquity", "candidates": ["If classical mechanics discussed space during the Renaissance, I wonder what they'd think about quantum mechanics and multiverse theories now!", "So regarding aliens, do you lean towards any particular theory like the Fermi Paradox or the Drake Equation?", "Considering those ancient debates, it\u2019s fascinating how our current technology like the James Webb Space Telescope might finally answer some of those age-old questions.", "I\u2019ve read that some Renaissance thinkers like Giordano Bruno even hypothesized about an infinite universe. Do you think they were close to understanding modern cosmology?"]}
{"context": "New Age\nYes it's a pretty recently spiritual movement. Do you know much about New Age spiritualism?\nI know it's more prevalant in the Wetsern United States than the Eastern. If even gets influense from UFO Conspiracy theorists for some reason.\nInteresting. I didn't know that. I guess I can see the connection since they both deal in the unseen.\nI'm not sure it's mysticism. Its just a pseudoscientific alternative where people use crystals for medicine.\nWhat are the crystals supposed to do? Why do they use them?\nThey have healing powers, I'm more into crystals", "candidates": ["Oh, healing powers? That's fascinating. How exactly are these crystals used in healing practices?", "That's intriguing. Do you collect specific crystals based on their purported healing properties, or how do you decide which ones to use?", "Crystals for healing\u2014that's really unique. Have you personally experienced any benefits from using them?", "I've heard of crystal healing but never delved into it. Can you explain what makes one crystal better for healing than another?"]}

How about you?\nYes I am a fan, I am not a fan though of iowa painting their opposing teams locker rooms pink haha", "candidates": ["Haha, that's just one of those weird traditions in sports. It's all in good fun, but yeah, it can seem a bit odd.", "I've heard that's supposed to mess with the team's focus. Psychological warfare on the gridiron!", "Oh, the pink locker room at Iowa? It's definitely unique. Guess it adds some character to the game.", "Yeah, it's quite the statement! Do you think it actually impacts the performance of the visiting team?"]}

Do you dream a lot?\nSometimes! I don't always remember my dreams, though. I've heard about people who are able to interpret dreams and read into your self-conscious, but I've never really believed any of that.\nYeah, I don't believe in that either. The attempt at drawing meaning from dreams, which is dream interpretation. I don't believe in that either. How about you?\nIt sounds about as reliable as palm reading, to me. I think that dreams can sometimes reflect that you're thinking about something, but when someone says that my dream about the beach means that I need to call my mom? I have trouble believing that lol\nYeah, I totally agree and believe the same way you do! Like, I do not even understand why the word oneirology even exists. It is the scientific study of dreams which is crazy! Lol you can't study someone elses dream lol\nThat's so weird! It's so hard to remember dreams in the first place, I imagine that would be such an inexact science. Have you ever been able to lucid dream before?\nI have not had a lucid dream. Isn't that a dream in which the dreamer is aware they are dreaming? Have you had one?", "candidates": ["Yeah, lucid dreaming is when you're aware and can sometimes control the dream.

{"context": "How do you feel about Fleetwood Mac? A little dysfunctional but a great band...\nI've never been impressed with them musically, but I can appreciate their longevity despite the drama.", "candidates": ["I respect that. Not every band's sound resonates with everyone. Got any favorites of your own?", "That's fair; their style isn't for everyone. The drama does add a layer to their legacy, though, doesn't it?", "Interesting take. I've always thought their personal struggles fed into their music.

But the humanitarian cost was just too high.", "Do you think there's a better way to handle border security that doesn't involve such harsh measures?", "It's such a complex issue. The images of those kids were heart-wrenching. Have you been following what's happening with the families now?"]}

Maybe we can get a group together for a skate session, distract ourselves a bit?"]}
{"context": "Hello, do you like football?\nI do its one of my favorite sports, what about you? Do you like it?\nI find it hard to follow though the yellow line does help. ESPN got an emmy for that.\nThats fair, the yellow line may seem like a little thing but it really changed the game. Football stadiums are quite expensive to make\nI wonder how many of them have temporary courts. The Eagles set up a stadium due to their fans bad behavior.\nI guess that works that saves time and keeps fans in line, 14 out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are college football stadiums\nWow, interesting. I wonder how much Cumberland spent on their stadium. In 1916 they lost a game 22 to 0 to Georgia Tech.\nMaybe not a lot, maybe they retired from football after that defeat.", "candidates": ["That's true, they probably had different priorities. Switching topics, do you also follow college football or just the NFL?", "I think you're right, that defeat was historic though! Speaking of historic, do you have a favorite iconic game?", "Ah, yeah, makes sense. Also, I've heard some interesting technology is used in games now, like helmet cams.

Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?!\nWe did not, instead we had to park very far away and walk the rest for the first entire day. Eventually the people came back and moved the cars in the middle of the first night so we had to sacrifice more time the next day to retrieve our car.", "candidates": ["Oh no, that's terrible! How was the rest of your trip, though? Did it make up for that rough start?", "What a nightmare! Did you complain to the owner or leave a review to warn others?", "That\u2019s really inconsiderate of them.

{"context": "I cant stop drinking. How can I stop?\nYou are alcohol dependent, and will need help. You can't just do it on your own.

Their purpose is to \"stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.\" Go to a meeting!\nWhat happens if I relapse?\nWell, I think most of them have had the recurrence of alcohol use after they quit.

With a solid draft and Roethlisberger's leadership, they've got a good shot next season.", "Definitely, Big Ben's got a strong arm. But, remember, he's had his share of injuries.

{"context": "Do you tend to follow elections in the country?\nYes I plan to, it heard to decide who to vote for, I almost gave up on voting at one point.\nI know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option.

I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now.", "candidates": ["That's responsible of you. I feel more inclined to research too, any resources you recommend for making informed decisions?", "Research is key, I suppose. How do you manage to find the time with such busy lives we lead?", "I admire your dedication. Did last election\u2019s results influence your decision to be more active?", "Good on you. Do you align with a particular party, or do you weigh each candidate's platform regardless of party?"]}

Have you tried to be friends again?\nNo. I am too embarassed to reach out to her after all these years.", "candidates": ["I understand. Reconnecting can be tough, but if that friendship meant a lot, maybe it's worth the risk?", "That's completely normal, but perhaps she's waiting for you to make the first move?", "Sometimes it's best to leave the past behind us. Are you content with keeping the memory?", "Embarrassment can be powerful, but so can reconciliation. Could there be a way to ease into contacting her again?"]}

They cannot regulate their heat like most other dogs, so they can overheat easily\nYes the high costs of maintaining their health add to the overall cost, but they are great dogs.\nThey do require constant attention though because they can suffer from seperation anxiety after only a couple of hours", "candidates": ["Absolutely, their separation anxiety can be challenging. It's important for potential owners to consider if they can provide the necessary time and affection.", "That's true, providing companionship is essential. It's a commitment, not just emotionally but also in terms of time availability.", "Indeed, their need for attention means they're not the best fit for people with full-time jobs away from home. It's something to think about before getting one.", "Separation anxiety is rough on them. It makes finding the right family dynamic for a French Bulldog really important for their well-being."]}

It's light in color and flavor, with just a little bit of a bitter taste from the hops.", "It's a basic, refreshing beer. Not as heavy or dark as a stout, and not as fruity or spicy as other kinds.

Do you?\nI use google mail and google docs, is there any other search engine besides google?\nI think Bing still exists, but I don't know anyone who actually uses it. A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! Amazing the technology that's readily available.\nIt is amazing how faster computers are. And those computers in the 60s, were among the fastest that they could build at the time. As for google's services.

{"context": "I love reading about World War II. It's amazing to think that it involved over 100 million people.\nI did not know that so many people were involved, im afraid to think how many of those died\nIt's hard to pin down, but most people say between 50 to 85 million casualties. That's more than the population of most countries!\nThat is so tragic, would you happen to know which country had the most casualties?\nAbsolutely. Most of them were civilians in the Soviet Union (a.k.a. Russia) and China. But there were still millions of soldiers that died, as well.\nOh, you would think most would be germans, since they started it all didnt they?\nWe often say that Germany started the war in 1939.

The entire rat-pack would have been amazing to see. I've seen impersonators only.", "candidates": ["The Rat Pack truly epitomized an era of cool. It's a shame we missed it, but listening to their recordings is the next best thing!", "Absolutely, seeing the Rat Pack live would've been a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Those impersonator shows do capture some magic though.", "Frank Sinatra Jr. did carry on the legacy well. It's great that we can still experience a piece of that history through his performances.", "I agree, the whole group had a special charisma on stage. The recordings are timeless, but nothing beats the energy of a live show."]}

Speaking of Linkin Park, do you have a favorite album or song by them?", "You're right, concerts in historic venues must have a unique atmosphere. I'd love to experience that.

It's amazing that they were able to find and rescue the girl.\nYeah, its amazing how tourists are prime targets no matter where in the world you go.

It's horrible that they target innocent people like that.\nYeah, there is always some evil person out there. That reminds me of that Maryland shooting at a liquor store. The victim was only 25 years old.\nThat story was an awful one. I heard the victim and the shooter knew each other, but I can't say any personal dispute would justify the shooting.\nOh so that was the story behind it. That is odd.

Could you tell me more?", "Really? What is Reduit about? Sounds like it could be helpful for my program.", "That's interesting. I've never heard of Reduit.

{"context": "Hello. What is your favorite color? I like blue. It's one of the three primary colors in painting.\nI personally like green but I think it varies based on my mood.\nColor psychology is actually the study of hues as a determinant of behavior\nWhat does that mean?\nIt can influence perceptions that are unconscious, such as how food tastes. It also can enhance the effectiveness of placebos.\nAh, that is interesting. Is it because some colors are associated with certain emotions - such as blue and sadness\nMost blues have a mixture of other colors, azure has some green, and aquamarine has violet. It is hard to tell.\nDo you like to paint?\nI do not like to paint houses, if that is what you mean. An optical effect called Tyndal is why eyes look blue. Kind of interesting.l", "candidates": ["That\u2019s fascinating! Speaking of eyes, does that mean color perception affects eye color, or is it just the scattering of light?", "Huh, the Tyndall effect is new to me. Does that relate to color perception in art as well, or just in natural phenomena?", "I've never heard of the Tyndall effect. Sounds intriguing! Can you explain how that works in more detail?", "The Tyndall effect? That's about blue light scattering, right? So, is that why the sky is blue as well?"]}
{"context": "Not sure, I am a personal trainer during business days.\nOh, I guess there would be more then casino jobs out there.\nYeah, training is a super nice market here.

Or have you just gambled outside of Vegas?\nI've never been to Vegas. I would love to go some time.\nIt's a super nice place. It's way more than just Casinos.

Just seen stuff on TV.", "candidates": ["Really? You should definitely check out a live show! There's a lot of energy you don't get from TV.", "I bet a live show is a whole different experience. Maybe you can catch Penn and Teller one day?", "That surprises me! Being in Vegas, you've got to catch a live show. It's on a different level!", "You're missing out! Live magic has this exciting vibe. Hope you get to experience it soon."]}
{"context": "Hello! Would you rather eat a fish or have one as a pet?\nI think I'd rather eat them, although goldfish are known have lived up to 43 years! That is one old pet!\nA 43-yr old goldfish would turns some heads. And since the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, is could turn their heads too.", "candidates": ["Ha, true! But imagine a seahorse trying to turn to look at a 43-year-old goldfish. Nature's quirks are fascinating!", "Well, a seahorse neck-off would be interesting! Ever heard of other fish with quirky features?", "Good one! Seahorses have all the luck, it seems. I guess that's one fish that won't be getting away from a predator by a head turn.", "That's hilarious! Seahorses would give anything a good look. I'm always amazed by the variety of the underwater world."]}

I miss steak sometimes, but I feel good. Sure, I'd love to ride in your Tahoe.", "Flies like fruit, huh? That's funny. Still, can't argue with a Chevy Tahoe ride!", "Well, we all have our diets!

There might be options that can help you regain a sense of independence.", "I'm truly sorry. Your feelings are completely valid.

Have you found any hidden gems in that vast library of e-books?", "5.9 million is overwhelming! How do you choose what to read next?", "Wow, that's a lot of books!

Maybe you could explore books on political satire or history?", "That's an unusual but intriguing choice! Have you considered reading autobiographies of presidents or political analysts to enhance that interest?", "Really? I've never thought to read those for fun.

How about you?\nI straighten it too. Whilst I don't feel like it defines me, I think straight hair has a higher prestige than curly hair\nInteresting. I have never thought about that at all. I think curly hair is beautiful!\nI think the social stigma comes from all of the'straightening'products that are marketed for curly-haired people\nWell now it seems curls are back in style. It's so funny how fashion goes back and forth.\nYes; I feel that it's coming back for sure. What type of curls do you have?

A bad movie can really kill the vibe on a night out.", "True, at home a bad film is just a switch away from a new one. At the theater, it's a commitment."]}

Flexibility with good earning potential if you hone a skill.", "Why not try a part-time job? It can be anything from retail to food service.

{"context": "I play the acoustic guitar, if you didn't know it's different from the electric because it transmits the vibration of the strings to the air rather than to an amplifier.\nThe acoustic guitar it is often used in which genre of music?\nWell I believe it can be used in a lot of genres, like rock, classical, blues, jazz, folk rock, and many others.\nDo you play the guitar professionally?\nI don't, just casually. I like to play just with finger picking, which is where you pluck the strings using only your fingers and not with an actual picking tool, it's a lot of fun.\nThat is a nice way to play it but does it hurt your fingers?\nWell I try to take breaks after a while so it doesn't bother them too much. There's also different ways to finger pick and they each have their own pros and cons, so sometimes I switch it up too.", "candidates": ["That's interesting! Have you tried using fingerstyle technique in any specific songs or genres that you find more challenging or rewarding?", "Switching techniques sounds smart.

That doesn't hold up very well in today's world.", "candidates": ["True, diversifying opera is key. We need fresh narratives and composers from varied backgrounds to reflect today's diverse society.", "Absolutely, it's time for opera to evolve. Innovative stories and modern composers should be as prominent as the classics.", "Exactly, promoting emerging talents and new compositions would invigorate the art form and attract a broader audience.", "I concur.

Does their experience in politics inspire you in any way, or are you looking to forge your own path?", "Have you ever thought of combining your guitar skills with politics? Maybe writing songs about current events or something to that effect?", "I imagine politics must have made for an interesting childhood.

Travel is the movement of people between distant geographic locations and can be down by foot, bicycle, car, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage and can be one way or round trip.\nAnd bicycle or horse is the preferred way to travel on Mackiac island, where motors are banned.\nAbsolutely! I found out recently that travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements so maybe I've traveled more than I realized before.\nNaturally. Though in Iceland people use domestic flights much more often because they have no public rail.\nI wonder if that is expensive for them? Maybe only the business people do that. Did you know that air travel is up to 10% slower than it was in the 1960s in order to save on fuel costs? I would think that travel would be faster since the 60s.", "candidates": ["Yes, air travel is slower, but advancements in comfort and entertainment make it more bearable. I wonder how fuel economy has affected ticket prices over time?", "Actually, domestic flights in Iceland are pretty common for residents due to the tough terrain. And yeah, fuel savings have influenced speed nowadays.", "It's fascinating how economics influence air travel speed. As for Iceland, those flights are part of daily life for many, not just business.", "The cost and time balance is tricky. For Icelanders it's often a necessity rather than a luxury, and slower flights might be a small price to pay for fuel efficiency."]}

Makes the whole experience even better, you know?", "They're in-ground pools, thankfully. Much nicer aesthetic and swimming feels more immersive, don't you think?", "There's one of each, actually. But like you, I definitely have a preference for the in-ground pool. It just has a better vibe.", "In-ground for sure. They blend into the landscape nicely and are super accessible.

He's a legend in his own right.", "That's an interesting take.

It's more about image; players want to look cool on the court!", "The granny shot isn't banned; it's just that no one has the guts to use it in a game! Remember how Rick Barry was killing it with those underhand free throws?", "Well, they didn't exactly ban the granny shot, but it's interesting how image influences players more than effectiveness sometimes.

I know there were a few who did and of course they were some of the best in league history. Ric Barry comes to mind, but that's a guess.\nNBA stars wear funny looking sneakers, and that doesn't seem to bother them. Probably because it comes with a nice paycheck. Air Jordans were banned originally by the NBA, but Jordan wore them anyway because Nike would pay the fine. Sounds like the NBA had a nice way to pocket some cash off of the deal.\nYeah and I'm sure the fine was nothing compared to how much marketing they got. Imagine, a shoe that you can buy and wear that makes you a better player, gives you a proven advantage? To a ton of people, sold.\nLots of money in sports marketing. Iverson signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Reebok that would pay him $800,000 per year until he reached 55, and then he would get a lump sum of $32 mil. Another sale\u2026\nYeah imagine how Reebok feels about that now, I don't think Iverson shoes sell much anymore, I think they thought they were signing a new Jordan.", "candidates": ["Definitely a gamble. Investing in athletes is risky. AI was iconic, but not every player's legacy translates to enduring sneaker sales.", "True, but legends like Iverson influence beyond their playing days. Maybe Reebok's banking on nostalgia to keep sales alive.", "Reebok's still in the game though. AI\u2019s impact goes beyond just shoe sales. It's about brand identity and culture.", "It's all hindsight. Iverson's brand might have slowed down, but at his peak, that deal probably looked like a steal for Reebok."]}

I've days off", "candidates": ["Oops, I misspoke! I meant I have three kids, so it's tough to consider an office job with my home responsibilities.", "Apologies for the confusion, I'm a single father, which makes a tech job challenging.", "Haha, \"own\" was the wrong word. Being a parent to three kids keeps me on the road for now.", "My bad, I have three kids to look after. Trucking offers me the flexibility I need."]}
{"context": "I'm not suprised that I will get a raise\nOh yea did you do a good job to get one?\nI brought the biggest clients for 2 years in a row :)", "candidates": ["Wow, that's quite the achievement!

Do you have any secrets for landing such big clients consistently?", "You definitely earned it, then! How much of a raise are you expecting after such success?", "Bringing in big clients is no small feat. What\u2019s your next goal after clinching the raise?"]}

Also, a fishing license is critical, depending on where you\u2019re heading.", "Apart from a rod and reel, I always pack a net, some basic tackle like swivels and weights, and I don\u2019t forget snacks and a cooler for the catch!", "I make sure to have my rod, reel, a selection of baits, a tackle box, and, of course, a hat and polarized sunglasses for eye protection and better water visibility."]}
{"context": "Swimming\nYes it is amazing, and it is true that most animals seem to know how to swim without any learning involved.\nI love swimming.

It's a lot of fun and I like it a lot. Where do you surf?\nIt's a full body workout~ And oh jeez I've surfed all over the place! Moved around a lot as a kid since my dad was in the army\nYou're so lucky! I would have loved to move around when I was younger. I'm a social butterfly. Do you make a lot of friends when surfing?\nNot really :( I'm kind of a loner. You're the lucky one! I wish I could talk to people more openly\nI used to have a hard time making buddies. Now it comes naturally. I'd suggest just putting yourself out there and trying!\nTrue, true I guess that takes practice just like most things :o", "candidates": ["Absolutely, practice makes perfect! Maybe join a local surf club or beach events to mingle with others who share your passion.", "What about surfing competitions? Even if you're not competing, they can be great places to meet like-minded people!", "Have you tried surf meetups? Apps like Meetup can connect you to local surf communities.", "I totally get that. Sometimes volunteering at beach cleanups can help you meet people in a relaxed environment, too."]}
{"context": "Good morning, are you an NFL fan?\nA Little! How bout you?\nI am a big NFL fan, my favorite team is the Eagles.\nI like the redskins myself. They are doing really well.\nIt's a shame that Alex Smith suffered such a gruesome injury.\nThat poor guy can't catch a break! He says it happened because of lack of rhythm.\nIt might affect his career in that he might not be able to play again. Luckily he was able to make some serious money before this happened.", "candidates": ["Definitely, Alex Smith's contract was sizable. Still, I hope he recovers; the Redskins need him! Do you think they'll look for a new QB?", "Money's one thing, but to not play the game you love? That's tough. What's your take on the Eagles' QB situation?", "True, but no amount of money can replace the thrill of the game. Do you think the Eagles have a solid backup if Wentz goes down?", "It's good he has financial security, but such a talent sidelined is sad. Speaking of injuries, how do you feel the Eagles are handling theirs?"]}

What do you do?", "candidates": ["I'm a taxi driver, so I'm behind the wheel pretty much all day. Helps to have good eyes on the road!", "I'm a delivery driver. Spend most of my time making sure people get their packages on time.", "I actually teach people how to drive for a living\u2014definitely a job that requires full attention and sight!", "Oh, I'm an Uber driver!

{"context": "I love collecting old, vintage teapots. Do you enjoy this hobby as well?\nI doent really collect teapots. I use mine to steep tea leaves though.\nI see. I think different tea pots have a different impact on the tea leaves you heat in them.\nI agree. Are some of the vintage teapots you have made of ceramic kettles or old wine pots? I know some old ones were even bronze.\nMost of them are ceramic kettles since these are the best quality in my opinion. Bronze ones are quite expensive I think.\nThat is cool. The Yuan Dynasty in China invented the teapot.\nYes I remember seeing historical artifacts from the Yuan Dynasty when I visited the teapot museum in London.", "candidates": ["Wow, a teapot museum in London! Did they have a large collection of Yuan Dynasty teapots there?", "That must have been fascinating! Which teapot from the museum left the most significant impression on you?", "I've always wanted to visit that museum.

{"context": "Hi, how are you?\nHello great, what about you? Its amazing how the internet allows us to chat right now.\nI know. It is such a great invention when used for good. I remember AIM being so popular among younger people...\nI dont remember AIM, but yeah, when used for good its great, internet can also cause an addiction, for instance constant novelty clicks on links can become addictive for sure.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, moderation is key. AIM, or AOL Instant Messenger, was all the rage before social media exploded. Did you use any chat platforms before Facebook and the like took over?", "It's a balancing act with technology. AIM shaped online communication early on. Did you have a different go-to chat application back in the day?", "True, it can be a double-edged sword. Before people got hooked on social media, AIM was a simpler way to connect. Did you ever experience chat rooms or instant messaging before?", "That's a fair point about addiction. AIM was sort of a precursor to today's social media. What do you think about the impact of these platforms on our social skills?"]}

Pets can be a handful at times. What are you having for brunch?", "No pets, huh? They're like family members to us. What's stopping you from having one?", "I can't imagine life without our dogs.

He takes on projects that other big companies shun, like the electric car.\nTrue, he also founded paypal, space X and Tesla!\nHe is a serial entrepreneur. I wonder if he will ever get to mars.\nI dont know. I think if anyone can, it is definitely him.\nHave you driven a tesla? I would love to drive one some day.\nNo, I have seen charging stations though. I think it would be really cool. It is also neat that musk took a $78 million dollar pay but giving everything back to the company except $1", "candidates": ["That's true dedication to his vision. Have you heard about any new projects he's planning after Starlink?", "One dollar salary shows his commitment, but I've read his stock options are where the real value is.", "It's fascinating how he reinvests in his own ventures.

I'm really worried about the snakes.", "I appreciate the suggestion. But I'm also thinking about setting up traps or calling pest control.

{"context": "I love blue, Blue is one of the three primary colours\nIt is beautiful. Is the ocean blue or is the sky blue.

Is he a quarterback for a team?\nHe is and he is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.\nOh wow that is neat. I wonder if that makes him a better quarterback like being a lefty in baseball gives you an advantage.", "candidates": ["Being left-handed might give him unique advantages, like a different spin on the ball, which can throw off defenders who are used to right-handed passes.", "It's hard to say if it's a clear advantage, but it definitely makes defenses prepare differently, considering the majority of quarterbacks are right-handed.", "Some say it could be, as his throws come from an angle that's less familiar to defenders, potentially giving his receivers an edge.", "Lefty quarterbacks are rare, which can sometimes lead to unique strategic plays. But being left-handed alone doesn't necessarily make one a better QB\u2014it's about skill and strategy."]}

There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.\nI've never heard of them before.

Speaking of the first lady, Jackie Kennedy had an impeccable fashion sense.\nI agree! Jackie Kennedy had one of the best senses of fashion of all First Ladies!\nMelanie Trump looks great as well! I suppose it makes sense because she is a model. About earlier, is Donna Karen a bohemian brand? I'm unfamiliar.\nI think that is because she models her clothes after Jackie Kennedy", "candidates": ["Oh, I wasn't aware Donna Karan took inspiration from Jackie Kennedy.

Who started the whole rock and roll genre of music?\nGee, I don't know if it was one person only. It has it's roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock. Then then heavy distortion was added along with the extended solos.\nWhat other music genres do you like?", "candidates": ["Besides metal, I'm big into punk rock for its energy and grunge for its rawness. Each has its unique rebellious spirit that I really connect with.", "I also enjoy classical music. It's a total switch from metal, but the complexity and the emotion in it are really captivating.", "I've got a soft spot for jazz \u2013 it's all about improvisation and feeling. It's a refreshing change from the structured chaos of metal.", "Apart from metal, I love electronic music. The way artists can manipulate sound and create something entirely new is fascinating to me."]}

Country music takes its roots from genres such as folk music and blues\nIt's really my least favorite these days, I don't like the direction the genre has taken overall.\nMe neither. I would much rather just have a good arm wrestle haha", "candidates": ["An arm wrestle sounds like a blast! Way to get back to real country toughness.", "Haha, arm wrestling? That's definitely more authentic than some country songs today.", "Sure, let's do it! Beats listening to songs about pickup trucks and dirt roads on repeat.", "You're on!

He was actually picked third in the draft he came out of!\nIs that were the Ted Tebow attended?\nBoth Bortles and Tebow attended college in the state of Florida, but Tebow actually attended the University of Florida.\nWow you really know your football facts. When was Doug Marrone coach of the Patriots, I thought Bellicheck or old Belly as I like to call him was there since the beginning.", "candidates": ["Doug Marrone has never coached the Patriots; he was head coach for the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

He's been with other NFL teams though.", "Actually, Doug Marrone was never the Patriots' head coach. That's always been Belichick's role since 2000.

It's like they have a sixth sense for the worst timing. Ever thought about registering for the 'Do Not Call' list?", "That's super annoying. Have you tried any call-blocking apps? They can be life-savers.", "I guess it's just bad luck. Maybe try turning off notifications or setting your phone to 'Do Not Disturb' during important calls?", "It's almost comical how they sense the worst times to call.

I think it would be exciting yet scary!\nThere have been missions to search for life on mars. Only two viking missions, where the results came back inconclusive. I wonder if there was lifeforms previously on Mars?\nIt begs the question how life started here. Maybe not only just at Mars.\nYup! I think that's where astrobiology is needed, it studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of previous and future life in the universe.

Did they shrink over time due to changes in the oceans?", "That's true, they're from the Paleozoic era! I wonder if dinosaurs like T-rex actually ate them, or if they were too small to bother with.", "Well, everything was bigger back then, right?

Paper as we know it came from China, roughly in the 2nd century AD, well before parchment was widely used in England.", "Oh, parchment predates China's paper, but it's not quite the same. Paper's invention is usually credited to Cai Lun in the Eastern Han dynasty.", "Right, England had parchment, but no, that's a different writing material. The Chinese invention of paper was distinct and more versatile than parchment.", "Parchment is more like leather, made from animal hide, whereas paper is plant-based.

I think radio is good for talk shows though.\nYeah I use YouTube all the time as well that is really good for music. And I agree, the radio is great for those.\nDJs can be pretty cunning.

Clever DJs know how to play the game. Have you ever been tricked into liking a song that way?", "Mystery does add spice to things. It's like a blind taste test for music.

So it's all about light scattering, not color?", "Wow, that's like how the sky gets its color! Nature is full of surprises.", "Tyndall scattering sounds like a scientific concept. Can you explain it to me in simple terms?"]}

It is tough not have a source of income.\nI felt out of place because I have a few tattoos on my face.\nOh, that is bold lol. Tattoos have been regarded as uncivilized in the Wet. People tend to associate them with criminals or people with mental issues\nYeah, I'm not crazy but I made a few mistakes when I was younger.", "candidates": ["Perceptions are changing, though. Tattoos are more accepted now in many industries. It's about finding the right fit for you.", "It's your story on your skin. The right employer will see past that and value your skills and personality.", "Have you considered roles where personal expression is celebrated? Creative fields can be more open-minded.", "Tattoos don't define your professionalism. Keep your head up and focus on your strengths during job interviews."]}

I really dont like reading about horrible news too. Do you like shirts? I hear polo shirts were originall made for tennis players\nThink I read about that. Lacoste right? The one with the crocodile logo?\nYeah thats the one!", "candidates": ["Yep, exactly. Lacoste made them popular. I like the style, but they can be a bit pricey. Do you own any?", "That's true. I've always associated polo shirts with golf though. Do you play any sports?", "Right, the crocodile is iconic. But I find it hard to shift from that grim news to fashion just like that.", "Lacoste did start the trend, didn't they? Kind of makes you appreciate how times have changed, from practicality to fashion statement."]}

He barks at every little noise.", "candidates": ["Have you tried figuring out what specifically triggers his barking? Maybe there's a specific noise or time of day that sets him off.", "Perhaps you could consult a dog trainer? They might have strategies to help manage his barking behavior.", "That sounds tough. Have you considered using white noise or soothing music to see if that calms him down?", "There are some great interactive toys that can keep dogs busy. Maybe one of those could distract him from all the outside noises?"]}

Maybe not as happily as you though.", "Oh, a power outage is the worst. I'd probably end up reading by the window or napping to pass the time.", "Good point. I should probably have a backup plan for power outages.

It's a symbol of presidential power.", "Funny, but it's not accurate. The White House is huge and historic, with many rooms for different functions, not just for guests.", "Interesting thought, but no, the White House is quite large and serves many purposes beyond hosting guests. It's an important landmark.", "That's amusing, but the White House being smaller than the guest house is just a joke. It's a large residence with many state rooms."]}

I have been playing it all my life.\nA violin typically has four strings. It is played by drawing a bow across these strings.\nYes, it is.

That \"dragon energy\" bit was bizarre, but he was on to something with that hydrogen power that everyone glossed over.\nHaha yes he definitely says lot of bizarre things. I think that he even believes AIDS is a man-made disease. He certainly has a lot of unconventional opinions.\nI honestly think the Kardashian/Jenner women made him that way. He wasn't like that before he got with Kim. I don't understand why he is a trump supporter.", "candidates": ["Well, Kanye's been controversial for a while, but you're right, his time with the Kardashians seemed to amplify things. His political views are another twist in his complex persona, aren't they?", "Perhaps the Kardashian lifestyle and spotlight exacerbated his tendencies. It's always tough to pin down why someone supports a particular politician, especially with Kanye's unpredictable nature.", "Yeah, the influence of the people close to him is interesting. But I think Kanye's always marched to the beat of his own drum; his support for Trump may just be another testament to that.", "His transformation has been something else, huh? I wonder if being in that family intensified his existing issues. And with his political views, I guess he sees something in Trump that aligns with his own beliefs or interests."]}

That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job?\nI sure did, thankfully I've been there a lot longer so they know me well enough.\nYeah, that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out.\nIt did, but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, standing up for what's right is important, but setting boundaries for self-protection is key too. How are you holding up after all this?", "Have you considered speaking to HR about the risks of reporting issues, maybe they can improve the system?", "It's a tough spot to be in.

I hate to see bad things happen to people but as someone who is not a Creed fan I find that hilarious.\nI don't know much about that band.

We give a lot of it away.\nFrozen pizza can also be delicious. It's really great that you are so active in the church. You should have a salsa dance group!\nOh, I'm getting too old for that lol.

Although, I'm not much of a romantic so maybe I should pick another genre. Any suggestions?\nI like mistery. Of course since Novels have been around for 2.000 years, there are all sort of genres.\nI was curious about the difference between a novel and I've also heard the term \"novella\". Is that the same thing?\nThe Novella tends to be shorter than a Novel. It seems the name novel began to be used in the 18th century,.\nI think I've chosen my genre thanks to you. I am going to write a mystery novel. I appreciate your help and insight.", "candidates": ["That's great to hear! Be sure to weave in suspense and keep your readers guessing.

They've got some that work great for old doors.", "Lamer porn, sure, but at least they had their privacy. Maybe time to upgrade to a modern lock?", "Yikes, talk about a heart-racing moment.

But \"universal\" might be an overstatement, as cultural perceptions of color do vary.", "Yes, blue does seem to have a broad significance. However, each context gives blue a different meaning, be it in technology or symbolism.", "Blue's universality could be debated. In some cultures, there are fewer basic color terms, and blue may not be distinguished as it is in Western societies.", "While Blu-ray is widespread, it's not the only use of blue in technology. There are blue LEDs, for example. But, the concept of \"universal\" is subjective, isn't it?"]}

That must have been quite a turn of events in court!", "It's appalling how people concoct such scams.

It just does not have to be on the big screens.\nSeems like a lot of people don't like having the news playing on the gym tvs neither, glad it's not just me\nStudies have shown that consuming emotional TV news can affect mental health and mood. What do you think?", "candidates": ["I definitely agree, the gym should be a place to de-stress, and news can sometimes make that hard.", "That makes sense; I work out to clear my head, not fill it with more issues.", "I've noticed I'm more relaxed during my workout without those channels blaring.", "For sure, less news could help keep the gym vibe positive and focused on health."]}

But that was way over the line!\nDid you do anything after she did it?\nNo, because I didn't want to escalate it further. My parents punished her, but I felt like she got off lightly. All she got was being grounded for a week and her phone taken away for that same time period. Oh well.", "candidates": ["It's good you kept your cool. Maybe consider hiding your scissors before you go to sleep for a while?", "I can see why you feel that's light, but maybe this will teach her a lesson without things getting worse.", "I'm impressed by your restraint.

Did you know that dunking was band for 10 years since Kareem had such a dominant dunk and game play.\nYes its crazy how big college basketball is. In 39 states the highest paid employee is a basketball or football coach\nThat is a wild fact. I can see it being true though because sports is what make colleges famous and popular. I know basketball is so popular that even the Supreme Court Justices play.\nYes I love the fact that the Court has a basketball court on the top floor - the highest court in the land!\nRight, that is a funny pun! They have a sense of humor for sure! Did you know that in New Zealand they call their basketball team, the tall blacks?\nI had never heard that. That is funny. My favorite team is Kansas - our only losing coach was the guy who invented basketball!\nYeah, its just a funny word so I thought I would share. Yes, I love Kansas too!

I've seen them in zoos, but I've never seen one in the wild. What doesn't your girlfriend like about that?", "candidates": ["She's worried it's dangerous. Komodo dragons can be aggressive and she's scared I might get hurt while tracking them.", "She thinks it's a pointless obsession. She doesn't understand the fascination with reptiles and would rather we spend our time on other activities.", "She's not a fan of reptiles at all, especially Komodo dragons.

Well, no matter how much I dislike it, Facebook continues to be a success. In early 2005, Myspace turned down an offer to buy it for 75 million. I bet they are regretting that.\nI know I would, sounds like a terrible decision, and I agree Facebook is growing at an incredible rate to the point a country is rewriting its constitution via Facebook\nIceland?

Plus, it's supposed to be calming and engenders trust, which is important for social networks.", "It's a design choice\u2014blue is a color that represents communication and trust. Also, it's Mark Zuckerberg's favorite color due to his color vision deficiency, which makes blue easier for him to see.", "Mostly it's because Mark Zuckerberg is colorblind\u2014blue's the color he sees best.

Maybe it's an isolated incident and community support could help ease your anxiety.", "Have you considered installing a home security system? It might help you feel a bit safer.", "That's unsettling.

Scary, right??!!\nHaha I would not trust my barber with my teeth! I'm guessing no pain relief either?\nProbably not. So I guess you aren't alone since France made decress prohibiting barbers from practicing all types of surgery in 1400. Wise move I think.\nThat is a lot earlier than I thought. I'm pretty sure I visited a Napoleonic era ship and they still had a ships barber doing the surgery!\nWell now that's fascinating! I read where publications devoted to dentistry began to be published in the 1530's. So to answer your first question, I'm really not fond of going to the dentist...or the barber now lol.\nWell in that case it makes sense to combine the two, so you only have to make one visit. I just hope they don't use the same tools for both jobs.", "candidates": ["Ha, a one-stop shop for all my grooming and dental needs? That's efficient but let's hope they sterilize in between!", "I think I'll pass on that combo.

I dont really expect the latter to happen.\nI dont really, I hope people can vote better this time around, did you know his not among the richest presidents in US history!\nI thought he would be the richest, but I guess JFK was very rich. His father had money.", "candidates": ["Indeed, JFK came from a wealthy family. Wealth aside, it's interesting to watch how socioeconomic status shapes a president's policies and public perception. What's your take on the influence of wealth in politics?", "That's true, JFK was wealthy, but wealth doesn't necessarily make a good leader. It's more about their policies and actions. Do you think the general public realizes this distinction, or does wealth still sway voters?", "Yes, JFK's wealth was substantial due to his inheritance. It's a stark reminder that many presidents come from privileged backgrounds. Do you believe that affects their ability to understand and address the needs of the average citizen?", "I was surprised too about Trump's wealth ranking. But it's not just about money, is it? Leadership qualities matter more. What qualities do you think our next president should have that Trump lacks?"]}

{"context": "Hello there, do you know much about robots?\nNo, I do not. What about you?\nJust a little bit. Did you know about Michael Jackson's robot he planned?\nI had heard about that. A 50 foot tall moon walking robot to roam the desert sands of Las Vegas. How bizarre, but he was a little eccentric, anyway.\nYeah that would have been pretty scary to be honest, but pretty cool too if he ever would have done it.\nDid you know robots can be controlled by using rat brains?\nNo I have never heard of that. But I guess the robot changes personality depending on which brain is used.\nThat's right, how freaky is that?\nSo freaky, I am curious to see what other advancements in roboting will take place in the next ten years.", "candidates": ["Definitely! With AI and robotics merging rapidly, the future may have robots that integrate seamlessly with our daily lives.", "I'm excited about advancements in medical robots. They could revolutionize surgeries and patient care.", "Robotics in space exploration could be groundbreaking. Imagine robots mining asteroids or building on Mars!", "Agreed.

I've a beet farm, and tonight the view was lovely.", "candidates": ["That sounds amazing! Do you grow different types of beets on your farm?", "A beet farm must be a lot of work! What's it like during harvest season?", "Oh, I bet the fields were stunning! Ever consider hosting farm dinners at sunset?", "Views like that must be so rewarding. Is beet farming something you've always wanted to do?"]}

{"context": "I want to be a teacher when I graduate college. I am thinking about elementary education.\nThat's interesting, do you plan to teach in the US? If so do you plan to teach public or private school?\nDefinitely in the US. I plan to teach in public school. I think public education is important for the country to thrive.\nThat sounds impressive. I went to public school here and I learned a lot. I think it's important as well, are you OK with the government setting the standards?\nI actually prefer autonomy at the county level to decide on standards. I am a big opponent of Common Core.\nInteresting, this is the first I'm hearing about Common Core. It is interesting these days with so many resources to be able to learn with.", "candidates": ["Common Core was an initiative to standardize education across the states. I believe more localized control can better address the unique needs of each community.", "Absolutely, the internet has revolutionized education. But it's vital that teachers guide students through all that information critically and effectively.", "Yes, and while Common Core meant well by trying to ensure consistency, it doesn\u2019t account for regional educational requirements or cultural differences in learning.", "Tools and resources are great, but they need to complement a curriculum that's tailored to the local environment, which Common Core often overlooks."]}

Of course, it will be.\nYou have to be careful, it might be bad if you use it too much.\nI agree with you, but I think this growth of hair would be my genetic evolution.\nMaybe. I think some people are just born with it.", "candidates": ["Perhaps it's a combination of genes and the oil. Still, I'll be cautious and not overuse it.", "You know, you might be onto something. I should probably research the long-term effects more.", "Genetics do play a role, but I also take good care of my hair. A balanced approach is key.", "Either way, I'll keep monitoring how my hair reacts. Experimenting is part of the fun, isn't it?"]}
{"context": "It's interesting how sometimes Americans joke about moving to Canada due to our politics, yet sometimes Canada's politics make just as much sense as ours\nCanada has many politics, but probably not as many as the US. The US has too many politics. What is climate change anyhow?\nClimate change is the more updated term for what used to be called \"global warming.\" Canada is starting to put policies into place that they believe will help with the said issue, but most aren't sure why, it seems\nI guess it's tricky. I would like to see some progress, but people seem reluctant to change. Plus, will it raise taxes?", "candidates": ["Absolutely, addressing climate change could increase taxes. Governments often invest in renewable energy and infrastructure to adapt, which can be costly but necessary for the environment's long-term health.", "Progress requires investment, which may affect taxes. But I think the economic benefits of creating green jobs and avoiding climate disaster could outweigh those initial costs over time.", "It's a common concern\u2014the balance between cost and benefit. Some argue proactive measures, even if they raise taxes, save money by preventing more severe consequences of unchecked climate change.", "Changes might indeed mean higher taxes in the short term.

It could be an exciting project.", "Wow, I bet you've got some thrilling stories! Ever thought of taking a non-flyer like me up for a spin?", "Growing up military must be unique.

I'm in South Florida where it's extremely hot but right on the coast so the breeze from the ocean makes it tolerable!\nThat's great! Florida is the 3rd most populous and 8th most densely populated state. It seems people are moving here!\nI moved here two years ago haha so I don't blame them! Living and working right near the ocean is an absolute paradise. Except for the drivers. Florida has the worst drivers.\nYes, I agree about the drivers. The mix of tourists, elderly, and locals create some hazardous conditions. Florida is at or near sea level. We don't have many mountains!\nIs that what makes it so dangerous when the hurricanes happen? I know near me they drain one of the big lakes when there is a impending hurricane.\nYes, flooding is a major concern as Florida has the lowest high point of any state. Retention ponds are used extensively for drainage purposes.\nIve never heard of a retention pond before. What is that exactly?\nIt is an artificial lake with vegetation around the perimeter, and includes a permanent pool of water in its design", "candidates": ["Oh, I see! So retention ponds are for stormwater management? That makes sense, especially with all the rain we can get here.", "Quite interesting! I've probably seen many but never knew their purpose. Does that help a lot with the flooding?", "Got it, an artificial lake. Are there any other ways Florida deals with hurricane floods, or is it mainly these ponds?", "That's smart planning. Does wildlife ever become an issue around these ponds given we're so close to nature down here?"]}

No I do not know that, why?\nBecause it was easy to dial on a rotary phone. An undertaker really?\nOh wow nice. Yeah he thought phone companies rerouted his calls to other businesses", "candidates": ["That's a pretty sneaky reason to invent something! Speaking of phone trivia, did you hear about how cell phones were originally called 'car phones' because they were so bulky?", "An undertaker, huh? I guess necessity really is the mother of invention. Have you ever thought about what might replace smartphones in the future?", "Quite the entrepreneur, that undertaker.

I thought I checked everything, but when I got home, I was really disappointed to find there was no cruise control\nIs it something that you can go back and have added on?\nI'm sure I can, at some point though I just got used to not having it though. I don't drive long distances anymore, so it really isn't as big of a deal now.\nLook on the bright side, you have a new truck. That has to be really cool.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the truck's got a great feel to it, and it handles my needs for now.", "Yeah, the new truck smell alone makes up for the missing cruise control!", "True, it's cool and practical for daily use. I'm just nitpicking about the cruise control.", "You're right. I'm mostly happy with it, and it's perfect for hauling stuff around."]}

The Portland Museum of Art has an amazing collection, and for nature lovers, there's the Eastern Promenade with stunning coastal scenery.", "Definitely, the Victoria Mansion is a must-see for its architecture, and the Casco Bay Lines offer scenic boat tours around the local islands.", "Yes!

Apparently they are watched more than CNN & MSNBC combine.\nYup they have lots of views, also it was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon, so two richards haha\nRepublican Media strategist & a President. Wow!\nHaha yup, did you know JFK was one of the top 3 richest us presidents?\nYeah I heard he shared the spots with Washington and Jefferson.\nYup thats true, I wonder where President Banana of Zimbabwe sits on that list haha", "candidates": ["Haha, President Banana's wealth probably doesn't stack up against US Presidents. Different economies and times!", "President Banana? Interesting comparison, but I doubt Zimbabwe's economy allows the same wealth as past US presidents.", "LOL, not sure about President Banana, but I imagine he doesn't crack the US wealthy presidents' club.", "That's quite a shift in topic!

Did you know the Hungary national football team only had one defeat in 6 years and that was in the World Cup final.\nI would not think of them as a top football team but I believe that was in the 50's so I missed that time.\nI wouldn't think so either.

It is the most important of the primary colors\nActually, what is a primary color?\nPrimary colors are colors not mixed with others, like the basics,\nSo, a color like green is a primary color?\nSure, but blue has been one of the most important colors since ancient times", "candidates": ["I'm a bit confused. Isn't green a secondary color, resulting from mixing blue and yellow?", "That's fascinating, but I heard that red and yellow are also primary colors, right?", "So every color I see is essentially made up of these primary colors in some combination?", "Does the importance of blue in history have something to do with how we use colors today?"]}

I would love to learn more since I don't quite understand some things about it.\nWhat I see is a lot of money. NBA players are the highest paid athletes on average.\nThat seems to make sense. I wonder if many hold onto it though. There seems to be a lot of fines in pro sports. Do you know how many teams are in the NBA?\nI think there are about 30. I haven't checked in a while.

I would not have done what Tim Duncan did: sacrificed money and stayed in college for four years instead of going directly to the NBA.", "candidates": ["Tim Duncan's choice is interesting; it shows some players value education too. Do you think that affected his career in the long term?", "Staying in college seems rare for athletes. Did Duncan\u2019s education benefit his professional life in basketball?", "Wow, Duncan must have had strong convictions to stay in school. How did that decision impact his standing when he eventually entered the NBA?", "I admire Duncan for prioritizing his education.

It can be tricky finding the right fit sometimes!", "Oh, you've got a height advantage! You're 6 inches taller, which might make sweater shopping a bit more challenging.", "You're taller by 6 inches.

Media impact on public health is a big topic, especially with such a wide audience.", "I've noticed that too. It's quite controversial given the influence TV shows can have, particularly on younger viewers.", "True, it can be off-putting.

Light rail is like metros or local trams, whereas heavy rail, used by high-speed trains, can handle more weight and speed, perfect for cross-country travels.", "Heavy rail is built for high-speed and large volume, like bullet trains; light rail is more for local, urban transit.

Do you watch baseball at all?\nYes, I do watch some games. I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises. How wild is that?\nYeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?\nMy favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too. Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle. Wow!\nBoth those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse?\nYeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat.\nThe best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the World Series is iconic. That Red Sox comeback was legendary. Regarding viewership, I think millions still tune in, especially for those nail-biting games.", "World Series moments are historic, no doubt. But, I bet with streaming, the way we watch is evolving. I'm curious about digital viewership stats.", "I'm always gripped by the World Series drama. Despite cord-cutting trends, I think traditional broadcasts still pull in a large audience.", "True, the series has a rich history. Honestly, I mostly follow the Braves' games, but I imagine the viewership must fluctuate with the teams playing."]}

{"context": "Do you know anyone who does horse training? That's where someone teaches a horse to do certain behaviors.\nI don't but my neighbor has horses and let's us ride if we ever feel like it.\nThat's really cool. Perhaps you can take up training them. They're useful for warfare, farm work, transportation, and sport.\nI saw some girls use horses for transportation once, they went through a burger king drive through. Texas for you lol\nI live in Texas and that doesn't surprise me! Haha most people just do horse training recreationally or for sport these days.\nI guess that leaves me as an odd man out, I am scared of injuries however, although I love animals\nI can understand that. Horses are very powerful creatures. Horse training in general is pretty controversial, depending on the methods of training.", "candidates": ["Yeah, I've heard some training methods can be harsh. What are some humane ways to train horses?", "Speaking of controversial, I've seen debates about horse-riding ethics. How do you feel about it?", "Totally with you on the power of horses. Any safety tips for beginners around them?", "That's interesting, I didn\u2019t realize training methods were debated. Any specific practices that are considered controversial?"]}

He did an amazing job as the Genie.\nI didn't know that either! I thought there was definitely others before him. I also found the information about Pixar studio having a secret room really cool too!\nYeah, especially in the early Disney films. I thought the same! It definitely makes sense for guests visiting the studio.\nI agree! Another thing I found out today was why McDonalds added the truth in in 1975! Did you know that?\nI didn't know that! I was really surprised to learn the reason. I thought it was just for general convenience.", "candidates": ["Yeah, it's fascinating! Apparently, the drive-thru was added due to military base regulations!", "Definitely! Convenience played a part, but it also helped service members who couldn't leave their cars due to uniform restrictions.", "Right, it was a clever move for efficiency. Service members couldn\u2019t go inside while in uniform, which spurred the idea.", "It's interesting how specific needs lead to widespread changes. The drive-thru was actually a response to soldiers not being allowed indoors in their fatigues!"]}

{"context": "Salsa (dance)\nOh I love to watch people salsa but have no idea how to do it myself\nYou know, it's actually not as old as people may think.

So, it's kind of an amalgamation.\nThat sounds amazing. I dont really do much dancing but I do love to go hiking\nThe question is which is better, Sals or the Electric Slide?\nI wouldnt know for sure but I would have to go with the electric slide if I was to choose", "candidates": ["Fair choice! The Electric Slide has that group fun vibe, perfect for parties. Ever thought about taking a dance class for fun?", "Gotcha, the Electric Slide is a classic line dance! Ever tried combining your love for hiking with some dance moves out in nature?", "I can respect that! It's all about what makes us happy. But who knows, with a bit of salsa, you might just discover a new hiking celebration dance!", "Interesting pick! The Electric Slide is more structured, while salsa is very spontaneous.

In comparison, if the entire earth's history were a 24 hour film, only 1 hour and 27 minutes would cover all of human history\nWe are so insignificant really when you think of it that way. And sadly we are destroying the forests so fast here\nI've heard more than 80% of them, and yet we still have so many trees.

What is the most popular horror filf?", "candidates": ["The most popular might be subjective, but 'The Exorcist' is often cited due to its impact when released.", "That's debatable. Recently, 'Get Out' has been a hit for its unique approach to social issues in horror.", "It's hard to say, but classics like 'Halloween' still have a massive following.", "For box office success, 'IT' based on Stephen King's novel is one of the highest-grossing horror films."]}

Flowers, chocolates, dinners, bring it on!\nHow long do you think is appropriate for courtship before deciding whether the relationship will lead to an engagement or marriage?\nI'm not certain it ever has to end up as either.

I usually know after about 3 dates whether I am compatible with the person and want to continue pursuing the relationship.\nPerhaps a relationship isn't always the desired end though. Can't people just enjoy each other's company and the fun of a courtship?", "candidates": ["You're right, the joy of the moment is often undervalued. Sometimes it's more about the experience than a specific destination.", "Absolutely, there's something to be said for savoring the present without the pressure of long-term expectations.", "That's an interesting perspective.

It's tough, but I suppose everyone learns something from such trials.", "Appreciate it. Sometimes, the hardest lessons provide the most valuable insights, don't they?", "Thanks for the sympathy.

She is sweet but she is being very naughty today. She is young and likely never got to enjoy life..she was exhausted after being malnourished.", "candidates": ["It's wonderful you saved her. Maybe she just needs some time to adjust and learn the ropes in her new, happier environment.", "That's tough; have you considered puppy training classes to help with her energy and behavior?", "She sounds like she's finally feeling better.

But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick.\nProbably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer. I wonder if they gave him something for it.\nThats a good question!

In space, without the atmosphere scattering the light, it would look white.", "I guess the yellow appearance might be due to how its light interacts with our atmosphere and our eyes' perception.", "That's pretty fascinating, considering how many cultures and artistic depictions portray the sun in yellow or even orange!", "I thought its color varied with its position in the sky \u2013 like how it looks redder at sunrise and sunset.

The puppy is a 12 week old Schnauzer, I guess they are super smart!", "candidates": ["Schnauzers have such a reputation for intelligence. Did she mention anything about how she trained him so quickly?", "That's adorable! Do you have any photos or videos of the puppy doing its tricks?", "I always wanted to teach my dog those tricks. Is there a special technique she\u2019s using?", "Incredible for such a young puppy! Do they plan to teach him more advanced tricks as he gets older?"]}
{"context": "One of my favorite bands growing up is the Rolling Stones. I can't believe Jagger is still performing today!\nYea it really is amazing considering that the Rolling Stones formed all the way back in 1962 in England.\nThat is amazing. I think my favorite son is \"Can't get no... Satisfaction\". I have heard it used to sell Snickers bars!\nThat makes sense as it targets the youth which they are good at. The Rolling Stones were part of the British Invasion of bands that became popular with the youth culture in the United States around the 1960s.\nYeah I think the Beatles were big back then as well. We have the Brits to thank for this period of rock and roll!\nYea definitely. So many pop and rock groups like The Dave, Clark Five, The Kinks, Herman's Hermits, and The Animals all contributed to the British Invasion and created rock culture as we know it.\nI also really like Pink Floyd, another British group from that time period. His music is just as popular today as it was back then!", "candidates": ["Actually, Pink Floyd's style was quite different. They pioneered progressive rock and were known for their philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, coming a bit later in the '60s.", "Pink Floyd certainly made their mark, but their psychedelic sound was distinct from the early British Invasion bands. Their album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is a classic!", "You're right about Pink Floyd's lasting impact. Their music was more experimental and conceptually driven, which really set them apart from their peers at the time.", "Interestingly, Pink Floyd started to gain momentum in the late 1960s, with their groundbreaking approach to rock. They're more associated with progressive and psychedelic rock, unlike the straightforward rock 'n' roll of the early British Invasion."]}

How do you make yours?\nIts a no bake so you just whip the cream cheese whip cream and some chocolate together it comes out perfect\nThat sounds very convenient! Do you kust mix and bake it then?\nYou dont have to bake it you actually have to put it in the freezer for 4 hrs so that it will stiffin together\nOh I see. How does the rocky road bit come into play, is it like a filling or on top?", "candidates": ["The rocky road elements are mixed in with the other ingredients. I fold in chopped nuts and mini marshmallows before it sets, giving it that classic rocky road taste.", "I sprinkle the nuts and marshmallows on top as a garnish after the cheesecake sets, so it looks and tastes like rocky road.", "The rocky road part is actually a layer of marshmallows, nuts, and chocolate chunks that I spread over the crust before adding the cheesecake mixture.", "I create a rocky road mixture that I swirl into the cheesecake batter before freezing. It creates a nice marbled effect and adds texture!"]}
{"context": "Good morning! What is your favorite animal?\nHello, I love sharks. What about you?\nHmmm my favorite might be a wolf, of all the 20 quintillion animals on earth.\nThat's a lot of animals! I saw animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they've been domesticated.\nMaybe a signal to others? Germany also gave all animals constitutionally guaranteed rights in 2002.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating about Germany\u2014it's great to see animals getting more legal protection. Should humans aim for such legal measures worldwide?", "Animal rights are crucial! How have these rights impacted animal treatment in Germany since then?", "Incredible step by Germany! Do you think those rights affect how they handle domestication and breeding practices?", "Interesting! Did the legal change in Germany improve conditions for all animals, including wildlife, or just pets and farm animals?"]}

I am glad your having a good day\nBoth my moms bought it for me, its a linux game.", "candidates": ["That's awesome, having supportive moms is great! Is Quake a new game, or has it been around for a while?", "Oh cool, it's not common to hear about Linux games. How does Quake compare to other games you've played?", "Quake sounds interesting! Do you play it competitively or just for fun?", "Never heard of it, but I should check it out. Is it hard to learn for someone new to gaming?"]}

Does your son enjoy the water as much as you do?", "It's awesome how swimming spans across so many purposes. Do you have a favorite spot you go to for your swim sessions?", "Recreational swimming is the best \u2013 no pressure, just fun. How old is your son? Is he taking lessons?"]}

Keyboard, and drums. What about you?", "candidates": ["That's quite the variety! I mostly play guitar, but I dabble with the piano too. There's something about creating music that's just magical, isn't it?", "Very cool! I'm a violinist. Learned it as a kid and just stuck with it. Sometimes I jam with my brothers \u2013 they play brass and woodwinds.", "Impressive lineup! I'm less diverse; I mainly stick to the bass guitar. My brothers and I used to form a small band at family gatherings.", "Wow, a multi-instrumentalist! I focus on drums \u2013 the rhythm's in my blood. Occasionally, I'll meddle with a harmonica for fun."]}
{"context": "Did you hear about that police officer that got sentenced to 15 years in prison\nYea, what kind of abuse of power is this?\nI know right, 15 years is a harsh penalty but she deserved it, she committed a murder and used power to cover it up\nDo you generally trust cops? A regular person may have gotten more time.\nI trust some of them but a lot of them are abusive just like officer Sherry Hall, her report was full of lies, makes me really angry, Its a good thing the Georgia Bureau of Investigation looked into the shooting\nYea... Did you know Cars came into global use in the 20th century?\nReally in the 20th century? I though it was a lot longer than that, I wonder who made the first model\nI think it was Henry Ford. I'm just glad they evolved to electric vehicles now. We have over 1.25 billion vehicles on earth.\nThats a lot of cars, did you hear about that pro driver that picked up his skills by playing Gran Turismo", "candidates": ["Yeah, I heard about that! It's incredible how gaming can develop real-life skills, isn't it? E-sports to real sports \u2013 what a transition.", "Oh, really? Gaming can truly be a training ground. I guess simulators are quite effective in teaching real-world applications.", "That's fascinating! It's amazing how video games like Gran Turismo can be so realistic that they help someone become a pro.", "No kidding? It goes to show how technology not only entertains but can also create real-world opportunities and talents."]}

Do you three always get along in the workplace?", "Oh, interesting! Is it a family business then? How did it start?"]}
{"context": "I really wanted to go with my family on vacation but I couldnt go and it sucks.\nThat's such a shame. Could you perhaps join them for a couple of days?\nNo I cant you know how work can be! Ugh adult life right.", "candidates": ["Ugh, I feel you. Work is relentless. Maybe a weekend escape for yourself could be rejuvenating?", "Totally get it, work doesn\u2019t pause. How about a special treat after they return to make up for it?", "Yeah, adulting is tough. Let\u2019s grab a drink later and vent about it?", "What a bummer! Have you looked into taking a mini-vacation later this year instead?"]}
{"context": "I love biking, I even competed in the Tour de France\nWow, that's a big accomplishment! How many people compete in that each year?", "candidates": ["Approximately 170 riders start the Tour, but the exact number can vary each year. It's an incredible experience to ride alongside the world's best.", "Oh, it's quite exclusive, typically around 20 teams of 8 to 9 riders each. The competition is fierce!", "Not as many as you'd think because it's a professional race. Usually under 200 elite cyclists are selected by their teams to compete.", "Well, it's only the elite pro cyclists, so around 170 to 180 riders. The number fluctuates a little each year depending on the teams."]}

What kind of movies are you more into\nI enjoy action, but there are some amazing nature documentaries.\nDocumentaries are very educational... But I prefer horror movies\nWhat's your favourite horror movie?", "candidates": ["I'd say 'The Shining' is my top pick \u2013 the atmosphere and suspense are unmatched!", "That's tough, but 'Hereditary' really got under my skin, such a chilling story.", "I enjoy classic horror, so 'Halloween' is my favorite. Michael Myers is iconic.", "For me, it's 'The Conjuring' series. The mix of history and supernatural scares is perfect!"]}
{"context": "Hi. Do you like horses?\nGood afternoon, yes, I do like horses. How about you?\nI sure do. Humans and horses have been working together since 4000BC. I think it's written into our DNA to love them.\nYes, I think every little girl dreams of having a horse. I had a pony named Peewee that I loved dearly. He was the best.\nThat's wonderful! I hope to have horses someday. We'll see. Hehe. Did you know that Clint Eastwood had what they call a \"mid-life allergy\" to horses? I sure hope I don't have that!\nI would think that would be an awfully rare condition to have. But, he's sure done enough Westerns and been around lots of horses in his career. Very interesting!\nFor sure! If I was a scientist, I would definitely study that whole scenario in search of answers! Haha, so I was reading about these 2 students who got suspended for riding their horses to school on \"no vehicles to school day\". Can you imagine! Sounds silly to me. They aren't vehicles, they are horses.\nI know I think I would have challenged that suspension, for sure!\nAbsolutely! I mean things like that can have a huge impact on a students future and that's just a silly thing to punish someone so harshly over. If I could get a horse, I'd get a Icelandic horse, if possible. They have this \"fifth speed\" called \"tolt\" which is just basically, speed-walking. Hehe which is adorable!\nI have seen them walk and it is so adorable. You know what I find so shocking is that the pretty white, fancy Lipizzaner horses are born brown or black and it takes them 6 years to turn completely white!", "candidates": ["Wow, that's a fascinating fact about Lipizzaner horses! Nature has some pretty amazing transformation processes, doesn't it? Makes you wonder what else we might not know about seemingly familiar animals.", "Really? That's like a natural magic trick! Imagine the surprise of someone not knowing about that change. Makes those horses even more special, in my opinion.", "That's incredible! Six years is a long time for such a dramatic change. Nature's methods are so intricate and surprising. It's a lovely reminder of the wonders around us.", "I did not know that about Lipizzaner horses! Their transformation pretty much symbolizes maturation in a way, doesn't it? It's like they're growing into their elegance."]}

It was stressful at first because they wanted so much information.\nOh wow, I can only imagine. Paperwork is not fun. I hope you got it all done eventually!", "candidates": ["Yes, thanks. It was quite a relief when they finally approved the loan.", "Absolutely, the process took a while, but the funds are helping the business grow now.", "I did, and it's already making a difference. I've hired two new employees!", "Exactly! But it's sorted now, and I'm focusing on the expansion plans we've got lined up."]}

I know they're good for when you're playing sports or moving around a lot.\nYes, actually I do wear them! When I was young I needed special glasses for soccer, I used to moved a lot!\nDo you wear your glasses all the time? I know sometimes people that don't use a strap so they can take them off and have them hanging around their neck when they don't need them.\nI only use them now while reading or at the computer, I feel like having your glasses hanging is son 80's right? How about you? Glass free or not?\nI wear prescription sunglasses that help when I drive. They are polarized and help as a visual aid but I don't need them all the time.\nThat cool, all my family wears glasses, even my mom she had perfect vision but with age, she needed to get them! Do polarized work at night? Is it not to dark?", "candidates": ["No, polarized lenses aren't for night use. They reduce glare from sunlight, so I switch to my regular glasses when it gets dark.", "Actually, polarized glasses are meant for daylight, particularly to cut out the glare, not great for night time though.", "I avoid wearing my polarized sunglasses at night; they're too dark. They're amazing for sunny days, especially when driving to reduce glare.", "Polarized sunglasses are best for daytime. They would make things too dim at night, so I have a clear pair I switch to after dusk."]}

They're a nice treat.", "Interesting choice! Coffee can be really comforting. Do you have a favorite blend or brand that you stick to?", "Hamburger from Subway is a unique pick! And coffee is a classic\u2014helps with the energy levels too, doesn't it?", "Coffee is a popular go-to for relaxation. I find milk calming in its own way. Have you ever tried adding milk to your coffee?"]}

Kareem abdul-jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade.\nYeah, officials are scared players might be hurt. I agree with it.\nJames naismith, the inventor of basketball, is the only losing coach in the university of kansas's history\nI find that a bit ironic considering he invented basketball. Did you know there is a team called \"tall blacks\"? They are in new Zealand.", "candidates": ["Wow, \"Tall Blacks\" is a clever nod to the \"All Blacks\" rugby team! It's a fun way to honor a national sports legacy through basketball.", "That's amusing! Names like \"Tall Blacks\" add character to sports teams. It speaks to a broader cultural identity too, doesn't it?", "Tall Blacks\" is quite a unique name. Do they have any notable achievements in international basketball", "I hadn't heard of the \"Tall Blacks\". Do they also perform a haka before games, similar to the rugby team?"]}

Do you like animal?\nI m always on my phone and I don t have that", "candidates": ["Oh, so you're busy with work. Still, caring for animals can be rewarding. Ever thought about a pet for company?", "It sounds like you've got a hectic schedule. I respect that. Maybe someday you'll find space for an animal in your life.", "No worries! Being on your phone a lot, maybe you could follow some animal rescue pages? They're heartwarming.", "Alright, I get it - not everyone's a pet person. How do you like to unwind after work, any hobbies?"]}

Have you thought of ways to connect with them during your free moments?", "Quality over quantity counts too. Do you make the most of the time you do have with your kids?", "That's a hard situation. Is there any chance of adjusting your work schedule to be more family-friendly?", "Have you talked to your family about how you're feeling? They might understand more than you think."]}

I own a cat, but man it seems like that thing only likes people when there is food involved.\nLol, but they do make great companions!\nThey do, don't get me wrong, I love my cat. Do you own a cat?\nNo, but they are quiet fascinating.. I mean these guys can see in near darkness!\nYeah they are certainly nocturnal animals.\nAnd their high breeding rate will ensure they stay around forever!", "candidates": ["True, their ability to thrive in different environments is pretty remarkable. Have you ever considered volunteering at a shelter? You'd learn a lot!", "That's for sure, but that also means managing their population is important, especially to protect local wildlife.", "Yeah, I've read that too! Their adaptability is a big part of why they've been companions and mousers for thousands of years.", "It's funny you mention their breeding \u2013 sometimes I think my cat's goal in life is to outpopulate the neighborhood with her lookalikes."]}

Nothing unique, workouts are the more important part.\nDo you have to give up carbs? Pretzels are my favorite I don't think I could give them up\nYea sadly you can't really dip into carbs, they offer very little.", "candidates": ["That's tough, but makes sense for combat sports. Maybe I'll just enjoy pretzels as a spectator then!", "Well, I guess my pretzel habit would have to be an occasional treat if I followed your routine. Discipline is key, huh?", "No carbs, wow! I might sub in whole grains to balance out training and my pretzel cravings. Ever tried that?", "Giving up carbs sounds intense. Do you find it hard to maintain energy levels during training without them?"]}
{"context": "Hello, do you go to concerts often?\nHey there I go to concerts a lot of the time actually, I went to Lollapalooza last year among some others, what about you?\nI don't remember specific venues! But I saw Linkin Park many years ago. I thought I was special till I found out they had 324 shows JUST that year!\nThat's so crazy! They must be exhausted at all year. What about Lou Reed? Him and his wife put together concerts for dogs, only the dogs can hear it though because it's a high frequency concert\nWow, that's sweet but definitely strange! People go crazy with tours, like the Ramones played over 2,000 concerts in total! They basically went non stop for 20 years.\nThat is insane! But I respect musical talents like Abba. They actually turned down a billion dollars to do a 100 concert tour. At some point you have enough money I think\nOh my good, but still I can't imagine turning something that much down. I wonder if maybe they didn't like the actual venues. Like there are ancient Roman amphitheatres still used as concert venues, maybe they are bad for acoustics or something.\nIt's a good point. But I also know that a billion dollars is a billion dollars LOL. Can you imagine if you saved Dave Matthews himself? Especially if you didn't know about it when you saw him. That would be so weird haha.\nAhah it definitely would be. Are you interested in other genres at all? I'm a fan of rap music to some extent.\nYeah I like rap music a little bit. I do like Jay-Z though. What about you, what do you think about him?", "candidates": ["Jay-Z's a legend! His impact on hip-hop is huge, and I've got a lot of respect for his business acumen too. He's more than just a rapper; he's an icon.", "Jay-Z is cool, but I tend to lean towards old school rap or more lyrical stuff. His flow is great, though, and 'The Blueprint' is a classic.", "Honestly, I'm more into newer artists, but Jay-Z has some hits for sure. 'Empire State of Mind' always gets me.", "I appreciate Jay-Z, especially his earlier work. It's amazing to see how he's evolved from musician to mogul, but my playlist is pretty varied."]}

The thrill of unwrapping a gift is like being a child all over again.", "Absolutely, and beyond the gifts, there's also that warm feeling of family togetherness.", "For sure, it's not just the gifts but the suspense of not knowing what's inside the boxes!"]}
{"context": "I wish I was an only child. I always hated having to share attention with my siblings.\nI know what you mean! I was an only child until my dumb sister was born, and she got all the attention!\nSeriously! That is why I will never have more children. I don't want my kid to have to experience the pain of ever having a sibling.", "candidates": ["I understand, but sometimes I also wonder if my sister gave me a chance to learn about sharing and compassion. It's complicated.", "It's funny how perspectives can change. I actually feel guilty for wanting to be an only child again sometimes.", "You might change your mind over time. Siblings can become support systems when they get older.", "I guess every family dynamic has its pros and cons. It's all about finding the right balance for you."]}
{"context": "Hybrid vehicle\nIt seems like more people are buying hybrid cards why do you feel it is better for nature?\nHybrid vehicles don't contaminate as much as regular cars.\nDo you own one?\nI don't. I want one though! My nephew is a big fan of elon musk and is a huge tesla enthusiast. I hope I can buy him one some day.\nThat would be great. Do you think self driving cars with become the norm in 20 years?", "candidates": ["It's definitely possible! Advancements in AI and technology suggest self-driving cars could become common, changing how we view transportation.", "Perhaps, but it depends on regulations, public acceptance, and the technology's safety record over time. There's a lot to consider.", "I think so. If the tech continues to improve and becomes affordable, people will likely embrace the convenience of self-driving cars.", "It's hard to predict, but if they prove to be safer and more efficient, I can see self-driving cars taking over the roads."]}
{"context": "Hi there. Hope you are having a good day! We use Amazon all the time. Do you?\nI do, both for entertainment and shopping. I actually ordered a pair of shoes yesterday--they've certainly come a long way from being an online bookstore!\nYes! From books to the largest internet retailer in the world! I've done my fair share to put money in Jeff Bezos's pocket!\nBezos is certainly a visionary; he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years; I wonder how that works.\nThat kind of engeneering is beyond me! But, it will be interesting for our ggggggg-grandkids to see if it is still going! I wonder if that first person who bought something for $27.95, had any idea what they were starting?\nThat's got to be the cheapest way to have a building named after you without dying haha. I doubt they foresaw that, let alone that their purchase would create the most valuable retailer in the US, the title for which Amazon took away from Walmart in 2015.\nI'm sure they didn't. There's a big difference between Walmart and Amazon, though they are both hitting sales pretty hard. Amazon has a contract with the post office to deliver on Sunday. But the few times I've had one coming on Sunday, it didn't actually arrive until Monday.\nThat's interesting, although it's not like they're known for customer service the way some other online retailers are. I've heard that they don't even treat their employees that well, either; a warehouse worker walks between 7 and 15 miles as part of a daily shift.\nI wonder if the warehouse workers bought fitness trackers from Amazon to find out how far they walk each day? I guess you definitely get your steps in, if you work there! I didn't know they owned IMDB too. That's the movie review website, right?", "candidates": ["Yeah, employees probably rack up steps! And IMDb is more than reviews; it's a massive database for movies, TV, and celebs. Surprising the things Amazon's involved in.", "True, working in those warehouses is like a marathon. And IMDb is Amazon's treasure trove of entertainment info, not just reviews.", "Ha, fitness trackers would be a hot item among them! Right, IMDb is under Amazon's umbrella, it's the go-to for film buffs for info beyond reviews.", "Absolutely, and Amazon workers probably know every fitness tracker intimately! IMDb is indeed theirs, a hub for all things movies and TV, not just user critiques."]}

Wonder why?", "candidates": ["That sounds traumatic! I guess chicken held a grudge. Was it difficult to handle that situation with the rooster?", "It's surprising the things animals do when provoked. Do you think the aggression is common in all roosters, or was yours an exception?", "Ha, a tough bird learns a tough lesson! On capons, I think some places ban caponization due to animal welfare concerns.", "Yikes, rooster for dinner, poetic justice? About capons, maybe it's banned for ethical reasons?

Once you get the hang of that there's graphite pencils, inked brushes, charcoal, pastels, and the list goes on\nWow that sounds kind of complex\nSounds more complex than it is, it's a matter of preference.

So, did he tell NASA?", "candidates": ["Yes, he did inform NASA, and they were quite grateful. He used a radio telescope setup that's quite complex. If you're serious, you could start with basic astronomy and radio operation courses.", "Absolutely! He tipped off NASA after his discovery.

To get started yourself, you\u2019ll need dedication and some technical expertise in radio astronomy.", "Indeed, he did. And do you know? His gear wasn't even cutting-edge\u2014just a normal computer and a radio receiver. NASA was thrilled.

Another thing is that dogs perform many roles for humans such as hunting, herding, and pulling loads.\nThey're very helpful animals, has that always been their nature?

I was really upset.", "candidates": ["That's tough, have you looked into other scholarships or financial aid options?

Jalen Hurts is a key player for the Eagles \u2013 great quarterback with impressive skills both in the air and on the ground!", "Arsenal, nice choice! For us, I'd say Jason Kelce is an outstanding player, really anchors the offensive line as our center.", "Oh, soccer! Well, on the Eagles, our dominant player right now has to be DeVonta Smith. He's been making incredible catches as a wide receiver.", "Soccer, huh? Cool. For the Eagles, keep an eye on Darius Slay. He's a cornerback with some serious talent, making big defensive plays for us."]}

What is your main news source for information on the President?\nI watch all the channels to try to get a more balanced view. I listen to the words from his own mouth mostly\nI understand.

What's your favorite type of coffee? I'm sometimes very picky when it comes to trying new things.\nMy go-to is a hot caramel latte, but I'm adventurous and like to try many things.

But what happens if you mix all three primary colors together?", "Interesting! Are these primary colors the same for paints and screens?", "That's cool!

Maybe you can clean out the closet to deter them, or set up some sticky traps?", "That sounds really frightening. Sometimes, keeping closets well-lit and clutter-free can prevent spiders from settling in. Have you tried that?", "Spiders can be beneficial since they catch other insects, but I understand the fear.

He's a huge Andrew Luck fan and hopes to ride him to a good season.\nI have never tried fantasy sports. How does it work? Do you bet or something?\nThere's different systems but the basics are that you make a team based on individual players and then play games. Your points are based on how well your players do. Some leagues you pay to join, I.e. Bet, others are just for fun. It's perfect for a statistics nerd. Like one who knows Luck's QB rating is 102.4.\nCould I choose the same players as your son then? No limitations?\nUsually you all choose players from the same pool. So only one person can have Andrew Luck, others have to choose different quarter backs. To make it more complicated, in some leagues you can sell your players. Use that money to buy new, hopefully better personnel. Or just sit that player out for the game and don't pay for him. Like Michael Thomas the WR will have a stiff defense to contend with so don't waste him on that.", "candidates": ["Sounds intriguing! So if I start late in the season, am I at a disadvantage? Do I get to pick from the same players or just what's left over?", "I like the strategy involved. Could you walk me through a mock draft sometime?", "Oh, it's kind of like a stock market for football players. Is there a cap on how much you can spend?", "Fascinating! Do trades happen often? How do you decide when it's the right time to trade a player?"]}

They should've hired his sister.\nLOL, did you ever own a pair of Air Jordans?\nI heard they were banned.\nThey were, but Nike was willing to pay the fines so he could wear them.\nAh...well if Nike would pay me, I'd wear them. Do they help when shooting granny style?\nI'm not sure, but apparently that is the best way to shoot for accuracy.", "candidates": ["That's pretty cool about granny shots, but it feels a bit goofy doing it. You think players like Steph Curry ever practice those for fun?", "Maybe I should start practicing granny shots then, especially if it ups my game; although, it'll look pretty funny on the court!", "Interesting, I've never tried shooting granny style. It seems a bit unconventional. Do you know of any pro players who actually use that technique during games?", "Granny style, huh? That's definitely a throwback. Not sure if Jordans would help with that, but I'd be willing to give it a shot if it improves accuracy."]}

We are similar.", "candidates": ["That's great to hear! How old are your kids? Mine are in elementary school.", "Indeed we are! Juggling parenting and everything else sure is an adventure, isn't it?", "Oh, nice! Do you also find the work-life balance challenging with kids?", "Sounds like we have quite a bit in common. What do you enjoy doing with your family?"]}

We're waiting to hear back.", "candidates": ["Is there anything I can do to help while you wait for news?", "Did the vet have any initial thoughts on what might be causing the vomiting?", "I'll keep my fingers crossed. Keep me updated, please.", "How old is the dog? At a certain age, they become more prone to health issues, sadly."]}
{"context": "I can't imagine being born with a visual impairment, can you?\nI would hate to have to wear glasses.\nI actually wear glasses, and it's no fun. What other types of visual impairments are there?\nIt is anyone that was 20/40 or 20/60 vision.\nOh wow! I think mine is way worse than that so I guess I qualify! Is being color blind a visual impairment?\nYes, if you don't have the ability to see color.", "candidates": ["That's interesting. So being colorblind is considered an impairment? Do you know if that affects one's sight in any other way?", "I hadn\u2019t considered color blindness. Are there treatments for that, or is it mainly managed by adapting your environment?", "I never really thought about color blindness in the same category. Does it impact daily life a lot, like for driving or cooking?", "Huh, so color blindness counts too. I wonder, are there different types or just one? Is it hereditary?"]}

{"context": "I have recently become a soccer fan. I never liked it growing up, but I have gained a new appreciation for it. Do you follow the sport at all?\nAs a matter of fact I am quite a fan of soccer, what do you follow?\nI really started getting into it during the last World Cup. It is amazing that soccer makes more money than football, basketball and baseball combined.\nI suppose because it is world wide. Shame the US did not make it to the last FIFA world cup.\nYeas, it is unfortunate. The US Women's side of things seem to have done a lot better in the Cup over the years. The men's team has a ways to go to catch up\nThe more popular it becomes the more kids will play. It's funny how two players born in England can play for America, but I guess it depends on the parents.\nThat might be the best way for US soccer to get a boost. Just like there are a lot of good European basketball players that come over to the states\nYes, you want to be with the best to test yourself. Do you follow English soccer?\nI do. To be honest, there are so many teams overseas that it is hard to keep track.\nI guess pick the ones with American players on them, like Tottenham, although they have loaned Carter-Vickers to Swansea.", "candidates": ["Yeah, it's neat to see Americans like Carter-Vickers getting exposure in top leagues. Spurs are fun to watch, but I like to follow players more than specific teams.", "That\u2019s true, I tend to keep an eye on teams with strong US players. Makes it a bit more personal and interesting to follow their development.", "I've actually been following Chelsea closely lately\u2014it's fascinating to see how Pulisic is influencing perceptions of American talent abroad.", "You're right, following American players does add extra excitement. Though I'm more of a Liverpool fan, it's the overall intensity of the Premier League that keeps me hooked."]}

{"context": "I had my car washed and the worker there stole money out of my car.\nDid he get a beat down?\nI couldn't prove it. I was so angry about it!", "candidates": ["That's terrible! Did you report it to the manager or leave a review to warn others?", "I understand feeling upset; maybe setting up a dashcam could help avoid such situations in the future.", "That's really frustrating. It might be worth it to not leave valuables in the car next time.", "That sucks. Have you considered switching to a different car wash place from now on?"]}

However I am a total beginner and I only have a digital camera which seem to clash with the definition you just gave me lol.\nI like oldschool film photography. A lens is used to focus the light into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside the camera.\nUgh I need to get some more lens for camera but they're so expensive and there are so many options.\nI bet your camera has an electronic image sensor which charges each pixel and process the digital image for display or processing.\nYou might be right. I have no idea. I think it is a mirrorless, that's all I know.\nDigital cameras capture photographs in digital memory. They are still pretty new, only released like 20 years ago.\nIt seems so old, but really 20 years isn't long compared to when photography started though.", "candidates": ["That's true, photography has been around since the 1800s. Mirrorless cameras are great for beginners \u2013 lightweight and user-friendly!", "Only 20 years, indeed! Yet, digital has revolutionized photography. Mirrorless is a great choice \u2013 compact, with excellent image quality.", "Indeed, photography's history is rich! If you're finding lenses expensive, consider starting with a versatile prime lens that's good for general use.", "Photography has evolved much since its inception. For your mirrorless, try renting different lenses to see what works best for you before purchasing."]}

But I am still amazed that they spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth! Who still gets dvds in the mail?????\nHaha that's a good question! I haven't used a dvd in 10 years, did you know Blockbuster turned down buying Netflix back in the day?", "candidates": ["Yeah, Blockbuster's blunder is legendary! Who knew Netflix would become such a juggernaut from just mailing DVDs?", "Biggest mistake ever! Just goes to show you never know what the next big thing will be. Netflix really changed the game.", "Can you imagine if Blockbuster had said yes? We might still be renting DVDs from them instead of streaming!", "Such a wild piece of history! It's like a lesson in not underestimating tech startups. Blockbuster must be kicking themselves."]}

Ever been to the West Coast?", "Oh, Kansas? I'm from the East Coast myself, New York City. It's always interesting to see how different our experiences can be.", "Nice, Kansas is the heartland! I'm from Texas, so not too far off. We're both from the state of big skies, it seems.", "Kansas, that's pretty cool. I've always lived in Ohio, so I've never experienced life in the Midwest.

It was started long ago back in 1911 by Louis Chevrolet\nIn what city and state?\nI'm not sure where at specifically. I guess he was into cars since he was a race car driver.", "candidates": ["Well, actually, Chevrolet was founded in Detroit, Michigan. It's fascinating how it's grown since then!", "That's interesting about Louis Chevrolet. I'll have to look up more about the company's history. There's a lot I don't know.", "Oh, a race car driver? It makes sense now why performance has been a big part of Chevy's identity.", "Detroit, Michigan, right? It's incredible how much GM and Chevrolet have shaped the automotive industry from there."]}
{"context": "Dirty Harry\nI do but Dirty Harry is my all time favorite\nI liked that it drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer.

It's how we evolve.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, understanding the extreme aspects of psychology can offer insights into the human condition and potentially prevent future tragedies.", "Definitely. Studying the extremes, like serial killers, can give us a better understanding of what drives human behavior and how society can respond.", "True, though it can be pretty heavy stuff. It's one thing to be informed but another to not let the darkness of it get to you.", "I get that, but sometimes diving too deep into that world can be unsettling. It's a balance between curiosity and maintaining a healthy mindset."]}

It's a massive undertaking for such a small country.", "Qatar is a bit controversial, isn't it?

It always sucks missing the good old days.\nIndeed. Nostalgia is one of the factors that drives my anxiety and depression to a certain degree", "candidates": ["Have you tried redirecting those feelings into something positive, like revisiting some of your favorite books from that time?", "That sounds rough. Do you want to talk about what you're feeling, or would a distraction help more right now?", "I understand. Maybe it could help to create new memories in places that are special to you, building a fresh perspective.", "I'm here for you.

Canada's bigger than it seems, it's 16 times larger than France.\nYea it really is huge. It has 10 provinces and it is the worlds 2nd largest country by total area\nWhile we\u2019re talking \u2018largest\u2019, here, it's good to know that Canada has the Earth's longest coastline at 202,080 km.\nIt is large, but it certainly is cold there too.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, those winters can be harsh, but it's also a winter sports paradise with phenomenal skiing and snowboarding opportunities.", "True, it can get pretty chilly, especially in the northern territories, but the seasonal changes are beautiful, especially the fall foliage.", "Cold, for sure, but that's part of its charm! You should see the ice hockey games; they're a central part of Canadian culture.", "It's cold, but that also means you can witness amazing natural ice sculptures and partake in unique festivals like Quebec's Winter Carnival."]}

My mom and my grandmother both have one which is not surprising since they're so alike- looks and personality wise.\nI recommend getting an older model to get started. The new Fitbits are expensive. Then if you like it invest in the newer version.", "candidates": ["Thanks for the advice! I might look into a secondhand Fitbit then. It could be fun to join the family Fitbit trend!", "Good idea on the older model. Any tips on what features are most useful to track health effectively?", "Appreciate the recommendation.

A floppy disk had more memory than that!\nI know, it's crazy right? I wouldn't get in one of those.\nMe neither. Apparently the Russians made a PC that ran on water, I wouldnt think that were even possible\nWow, is that even really possible? Like to have a computer run on water?\nI guess so! I would think it would get the electronics wet. Especially back then with their less advanced tech\nYeah, pretty crazy. Better not smoke near a Mac computer! It voids the warranty.\nI wonder why. I wonder why they consider it a biohazard", "candidates": ["Perhaps it's because smoking can cause internal damage, leaving behind residue on the components that might cause malfunction.", "I think it's about the tar and chemicals from smoke building up. It's awful for electronics, just as it is for lungs.", "Yeah, smoke can corrode the circuitry and also make repair and maintenance hazardous for technicians.", "I imagine the smoke particles are a nightmare to clean and could interfere with the sensitive hardware of the Mac."]}

If you ever find some free time, though, learning an instrument could be a great stress reliever.", "College can be demanding, but maybe you could start with something small, like a ukulele or harmonica!", "Yeah, balancing hobbies and studies is tricky.

I hear jim carrey doesnt make dramas anymore because his belief prevents him from playing in movies that dont project positivity.\nYeah, good thing he sticks to comedies though he is good at them.

Freddie Mercury was incredibly versatile, maybe the song didn't match Elvis's style, or it was penned in Mercury's typical eclectic fashion.", "Wow, I didn't know that either.

The girl who played the voice of Violet is Sarah Vowell. She's also a bestselling author of historical nonfiction!\nQuite a talented person! The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That\u2019s a great period for clothing and architecture.\nI agree. I like finding vintage items from that era. When they were making the movie the directer used artists that he thought were either likely to quit or get fired from Pixar.

It's a unique feature of their brain function.", "Birds can take micro-naps in flight. Some can even rest one half of their brain while the other remains active, enabling them to keep moving.", "That's a common myth!

I think addressing internet addiction can be complex, and while parenting is crucial, some cases may require professional intervention.", "That's true; technology has advanced so much!

Japan would be a interesting place, very different from here, different food, entertainment and clothes.\nYes, their entertainment is also very good, especially the company nintendo.\nIt seemed like all those video games companies were in Japan at one time, not so much now. Xbox is Microsoft, I guess Playstation is Sony and that's Japan.\nDid you know the Nintendo entertainment system could only display 54 colors back then.\n54 sounds like enough, not sure I could name more than 10. I suppose th games have way more now than 54, especially these new ones like Fortnite.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, modern games like Fortnite can display millions of colors, giving them vivid, lifelike visuals.

It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's!\nThe Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good.\nYeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats.\nI think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters. They want other options but there are none.\nTrue. That whole categorization didn't start until 2000 surprisingly.\nI think that the polarization of politics came with the Bush/Gore election. I am not happy that it has not changed. Now we need for independents.", "candidates": ["Definitely, the Bush/Gore election was pivotal, but I think the seeds of division were sown even earlier.", "I wonder if we can break the cycle - maybe ranked-choice voting could help diversify our political landscape?", "It's a tough spot; independents rarely get the spotlight in elections. Perhaps we need electoral reform.", "True, but even with independents, we'd need a system that doesn't sideline them. It's more than just having options."]}

Because being in New Hampshire in the winter is the pits.\nLol no, but I guess the weather and location certainly helped it become a hub of finance culture and art.\nDidn't really think about it that way.

{"context": "Do you use facebook?\nI do! I've had it practically since it first started back in 2004.\nNice, I stopped using it a while back to be honest.\nAh, I find it rather necessary for work and socialization. I bet the Myspace guys regret not buying it back when they were offered a chance.\nPerhaps, but remember Myspace failed, so what's not to say that they wouldn't have run facebook into the ground too?\nWell, they failed because of Facebook's popularity. I think it would've just created a super social media platform. Facebook you can decorate! Haha.

His artistic range goes beyond just music, really.", "Sure, rap, but Kanye's also produced for others and mixed various music styles. He's quite versatile in the entertainment world."]}
{"context": "Hello. I hope you do not eat meat.\nAnd what if I do?\nYou would be a murderer. As a vegan, I feel obligated to protect animals.\nI do not eat meat. I do, however, eat dairy and eggs.", "candidates": ["I respect your choice to abstain from meat. However, consider that dairy and egg industries also involve animal suffering. Perhaps explore plant-based alternatives to further reduce harm?", "That's a step in the right direction, but animals are still exploited for eggs and dairy. Have you thought about trying veganism to avoid all forms of animal cruelty?", "It's good to hear you don't eat meat. I encourage you to research the impact of dairy and egg production on animals. Being fully vegan is the best way to protect them.", "Even dairy and eggs can cause suffering to animals.

{"context": "I enjoy Indian Cuisine\nDo you like it because it is generally very spicy?\nYes there are some dishes that are not to spicy", "candidates": ["Totally understandable. Do you have a favorite among the less spicy dishes?", "That's great. How do you feel about the use of spices like turmeric and cumin in milder dishes?", "Spicy or not, Indian flavors are so unique.

{"context": "Cosmetics\nDo you have a favorite brand of cosmetics?\nI love them all especially the cosmetics designed to be used on the eyes and face.\nI like cosmetics made from natural ingredients. Mind you, the last time I went to the store for some there was a robbery and I was held hostage!\nOh my goodness! Really what happened?\nWell, I kind of knew what to do as my Dad is a retired police officer, so I just didn't look at the guy and waited for the police.\nWow, you must have felt so stressed and scared about that robbery. I can not imagine going through such an experience when just trying to simply buy some makeup.", "candidates": ["It was surreal, but thank goodness it was over quickly. I think the experience made me appreciate the little moments more, even just picking out eyeliner.", "Honestly, it's now a story to tell, but it really has made me more alert and appreciative of safe surroundings.", "The stress was intense, but in the moment, you surprise yourself with how calm you can be. I just wanted everyone to be safe.", "Scared, yes, but the police were amazing. It's changed how I shop now; I prefer buying cosmetics online for safety and convenience."]}
{"context": "Hello\nHello, who was your favorite US president?>\nDid you know that the new budget proposed will eliminate the Arts Program?\nReally? I do not think that is a good idea, they should probably keep the arts program.\nI agree. It would hurt a lot of people in the ways of technology and education. Trying to save money, I suppose, but I think there are other ways to do that without hurting the arts and technology of our country\nDid you know that the only US president to ever have a Phd was Woodrow Wilson? I thought that there would be more.\nI did not know that! It should almost be a requirement at this point. History and politics and some form of a degree sounds like something that the person holding the nuclear codes for the country should have...\nI agree, especially when the president is focusing more on their personal affairs rather than the country *cough* Trump *cough*.", "candidates": ["Haha, subtle cough! Personal agendas shouldn't overshadow national interests. Education is key, even for presidents.", "It's important to balance personal life and national duty. I hope future candidates consider this.", "Absolutely, a president should be well-rounded and educated. Maybe a higher bar for candidates?", "Indeed, a strong educational background could lead to more informed decisions from a president."]}

We need to be really attentive to their health though, because of those cute features.", "They do look cute, right? But their eyes can sometimes have issues because of how they're set, so regular vet checkups are a must.", "Thank you, they really are irresistible. That's why it's so important for us to know the special care bulldogs need, especially with their eyesight.", "Their eyes always get them extra treats!

{"context": "What types of music do you enjoy? Rap?\nI like all music but country and classical. How about you?\nI have been listening to rapping lately as it is a form of music that focuses on vocal delivery and rhythmic speech\nNice. I like classic rap a lot. Like Tupac Shakur. He had a large impact on our culture, so much that he is in the library of congress of \"cultural significance.\"\nI like that while rap share parts of hip hop, its history predates it and occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing\nIt's interesting that the word rap has been part of British English since the 16th century.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the linguistic roots are fascinating. It shows the power of words and how language evolves with culture.", "Indeed, it's remarkable how enduring the concept of 'rap' is. Any old English poets you think were proto-rappers?", "That\u2019s an interesting historical note. Language is so dynamic, constantly influencing and reflecting our artistic expressions.", "The longevity of the term really underscores the timeless nature of storytelling through rhythm and rhyme, doesn't it?"]}

Did the storm cause any issues during your flight, or was it smooth?", "That's a relief! Were there a lot of people stuck at the airport, or did it seem like everyone was getting out okay?", "Only thirty minutes? That's almost a non-event for air travel these days!

{"context": "I think blue is one of the best of the three primary colors, color theory is very fascinating to me.\nI agree but I always get confused, what are the other primary colors?\nRed Green and Blue make the set of primary colors, as they are the most prominent in the gamut of color spectrum ranges.\nOut of the primary colors, I think green would be my favorite.\nI love DEEP greens. Sage specifically. The hue is just so powerful and bold in tone.\nI think forest green is a great one but on the other side of it, seafoam green is great too.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, forest green has that richness, while seafoam brings a lightness.

Have you?\nYes, I love the Amazon original programs. I also use Netflix. Do you have Netflix?", "candidates": ["No, I don't have Netflix. I've been thinking about it though. Is it worth the subscription for their content?", "Actually, I'm more of a gamer than a movie watcher. But I might check out Netflix for its documentaries.", "Yes, I do!

Old habits die hard, I guess."]}
{"context": "Hello there. Do you enjoy the comedy genre? I love it because the main emphasis is on humor and I like to laugh.\nI love comedies!\nVery cool.

We don't have anything like that here in Houston, so that's great.\nIndeed, I think its so cool how many royal castles were used to take control of owns and the forests, In fact baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates.\nYeah, there is a lot of history there so you can visit all those places and kind of look at how things used to be.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, exploring Dublin's history is like traveling back in time. There's also vibrant modern culture with live music pubs, if that\u2019s your thing.", "Yes, and besides history, Dublin has a great literary scene.

There is an ancient Roman amphitheater still being used today as a concert venue in Croatia.\nYes that was a big blow to the band. I would love to see a concert there. In 2002 Creed had a concert so bad they got sued by their fans!\nThat's hilarious. I was never a huge fan of Creed. What about you?", "candidates": ["Creed's style never really clicked with me either; I tend more towards classic rock and indie bands. Have you heard of any recent concerts coming up that are worth seeing?", "I actually liked a couple of Creed\u2019s hits back in the day, but I lean more towards alternative rock now. What's your take on the current music scene?", "No, Creed wasn't my cup of tea. I'm more into electronic and pop genres. Any recommendations for bands similar to Linkin Park that are still touring?", "Creed had a few good songs, but I'm much more into punk and metal.

Have you ever tried any of her newer songs?", "Ah, I see. Have any other artists become your karaoke go-to since then?", "Funny how songs can bring back certain memories. What's your power ballad choice when you're feeling extra dramatic on stage?", "That's rough, but maybe reclaiming 'Have a Nice Day' for a triumphant solo could be empowering!

Did you know the NFL only has one left handed QB?\nI did not expect that. Only one? Why so few?", "candidates": ["Right, it's pretty interesting! Left-handed QBs are rare because most players grow up training to receive from right-handers. It's just what teams are used to.", "Yeah, only one. Coaching and scouting tend to favor right-handed players, which leads to fewer opportunities for lefties.", "Absolutely, just one. Some say it's because left-handed athletes often get directed into other sports like baseball, where lefties have a clear advantage.", "That's true. It might also be due to the way offenses are structured, plus the majority of people are right-handed, so it starts there."]}

So, the term 'singing' specifically refers to creating music vocally. Is there a historical context to the word?", "Right, so it's essentially a form of vocal expression. How does one improve their singing technique?", "Ah, that makes sense. So, it involves melodies and harmonies. Do you think there's an emotional component to why we sing?", "I see.

That part kind of annoys me, but maybe it helps him concentrate or something.\nLo, I am not sure on that, I just know he has been called one of the best NBA players ever. The Golden State Warriors are a decent team.\nI hadn't really heard of the Warriors before Curry came along. He helped them return to the finals in 2017 and 2018.\nYes he did!

I bet its heartwarming to look back at all of that stuff\nIT is, but there is so much I don't know what to do any more\nYou should get some good storage totes and pack it all up so its safe", "candidates": ["That's a practical idea. I'll look for some durable totes this weekend. Thanks for the tip!", "Storage totes could work, but I'd rather find a way to display some favorites. Maybe a scrapbook or frames?", "I've thought about totes, but I'm worried about things getting damaged. Do you know any good preservation methods?", "Great idea, but space is tight. I might need to sort and choose, maybe even digitize some artwork."]}
{"context": "Hello, we're talking about religion today.\nThat is an interesting topic since there is no scholarly consensus over what even constitutes a religion\nI'd love to hear more about what you mean!\nIt can just be defined in many differnt ways, there are so many aspects, likebehaviors, texts, places, ethics, all these things relate to spiritual beliefs somehow\nYeah, that makes sense. Do you know anything interesting about any religions you could share with me?\nTraditionally faith has considered to be a source of religious belief, and not really reason as much", "candidates": ["Faith as a foundation is fascinating. Have you encountered any religions where reason plays a more central role than faith?", "That's true, faith is often key. What are some unusual religious practices or beliefs that you know about?", "It's interesting to contrast faith and reason. How do different religions balance these, or do they lean towards one exclusively?", "I've heard faith can sometimes conflict with scientific understanding. How do you think religions reconcile with modern science?"]}

Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?\nYes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on. I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.\nI have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well.\nThe game Destiny turned me off gaming. It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity. Sometimes the old games are just fun. Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK. I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4.\nI was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating about PS3s and black holes! It really shows how powerful these consoles can be, not just for entertainment but for science too.", "Really? Using PS3s for black hole research is incredible. It's like our gaming systems have a secret double life as supercomputers.", "Wow, I had no idea they could use gaming consoles for something as complex as black hole research. Makes me look at my PS3 differently now.", "That\u2019s amazing \u2013 I never thought my PS3 would have anything to do with space research. Just shows how versatile these machines are!"]}

I don't think I ever screamed that loud in my life.", "candidates": ["That's awesome! Which coaster was it? The big ones can be terrifying but so exhilarating!", "Roller coasters are intense! Did the kids enjoy seeing you scream, or were they too busy screaming themselves?", "Wow, that takes courage! Did it rekindle a love for thrill rides, or one ride was enough?", "I can imagine!

Never wore them \u2013 I'm more of a tech fan than a fashion follower when it comes to Apple.", "Apple clothes? Can't say I have, but I wouldn't mind an Apple jacket to match my iPhone!", "I missed the Apple clothing era, sounds like a rare collector\u2019s item.

Got any favorite old cartoons?", "Oh, the struggle was real! It's crazy how kids today will never understand the antenna dance we did for a clear picture.", "Yeah, fiddling with the antenna!

Any experience like that?", "Exactly, it's a kind of pain that's hard to describe. Do you have pets now?", "Thank you, it means a lot. I think about that little guy often.

{"context": "My favorite color is blue. How about you?\nBlue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, and my favorite color too\nDo you prefr darker or lighter blues?\nLighter blue is what I tend to go for, cool fact about the color blue, it lies between violet and green on the spectrum of light.\nNeat!

{"context": "Hello! Do you like dogs?\nHello, to you as well. Yes, I love dogs. Do you?\nI do. I have one. Did you know that dogs aren't colorblind? They just can't see as many different colors as humans.\nYou know, I always wondered if my dogs could see color or not.\nNow you know. Lol Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing. There's another fact for you. Lol", "candidates": ["That's fascinating! I've pointed at things for my dogs before, and they do seem to get it. What kind of dog do you have?", "Lol, that's quite interesting. So when I point at the ball, my dog actually understands. Amazing!", "Huh, that explains a lot during our playtime. Any other cool animal facts?", "I've read about dogs following human gestures, but I didn't know about elephants!

What's your favorite book?\nOne of my favorites series is the Gone series by Michael Grant.\nOh nice! I love that Grant incorporates Greek mythology in his series. What do you like about his books?\nI love that part too. I just really like science fiction novels honestly.\nWell if you're into something a tiny bit supernatural, but still mostly sci-fi, I would recommend David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas. AMAZING book.\nI'll have to check it out sometime, I haven't read a good series in a while.", "candidates": ["Definitely do! Each story in Cloud Atlas is like a piece of a puzzle.

I love it", "candidates": ["Yes, I've watched Discovery. It's different from the Original Series, but I appreciate its modern take on the Star Trek universe.", "I do, although I must admit, I have a soft spot for the classics. Discovery has certainly expanded the lore.", "I've seen a few episodes of Discovery. It's interesting, but I'm more of a Deep Space Nine person myself.", "Actually, I haven't gotten into Discovery yet\u2014I've been rewatching The Next Generation. But I've heard good things about it!"]}
{"context": "Hi, how are you?\nI'm doing great! How are you doing tonight?\nI am very well, thanks! Do you like baseball?\nI watch baseball from time to time. How about you?\nI love it. Did you know baseball managers wear their uniforms in case they have to play? How weird?\nI think that is a holdover from when the game had one of the players act as manager too.\nI just like the mental image of sparky anderson trying to round first base and trying to leg out a double.\nI think Pete Rose might have entered the game from time to time, but he was really competitive. Sparky, maybe not so much.\nPete rose would have bet on the outcome and then entered the game.\nYeah, he was bad that way. He should have stopped playing at that point.", "candidates": ["True, his gambling overshadowed his career. Shifting gears, which team do you follow?", "Agreed. On another note, have you been to any live games recently?", "Yeah, his actions really tainted his legacy. By the way, who's your favorite player of all time?", "It's a shame when athletes make those choices. Speaking of playing, do you play any baseball yourself?"]}

I'll have to try those out sometime\nDo you prefer pork or beef meatballs in your pasta?", "candidates": ["I usually go for beef meatballs. They have this rich flavor that pairs well with tomato sauce and pasta.", "Honestly, I'm all about mixing meats. A blend of pork and beef in meatballs adds depth to the taste, don't you think?", "I'm not too picky, but I lean towards pork for the tenderness and juiciness it brings to meatballs.", "Meat preference really depends on the recipe, but I think beef standouts for classic Italian, whereas pork is great in Asian dishes."]}
{"context": "What's the weather like in the summer where you are?\nNot nearly as hot as it's supposed to be in DC! Upper 90s I hear.\nYeah, it is also hazy and humid. The humidity makes it so uncomfortable.\nTotally. Wasn't it the late John Candy who said \"It's not the heat, it's the humidity?\"\nYes, it was. Hopefully everyone in DC has an A/C!\nI feel bad for them if they don't. You gotta remember to get lots of water. It's heatstroke weather for sure.\nHaving a pool doesn't hurt, either!\nTrue.

Are there many shaded parks or cooling centers around for the community?", "Early birds get the cooler temperatures!

Maybe a lobster!\nWell, I like to think I'm a pretty good shot. You don't think it would ruin the meat though, would it?\nOf course not! What else do you do in your spare time? I play sax in a jazz band\nDo you? That sounds pretty rad. I already mentioned shooting bows, but I like to remodel homes as well. I find both to be very satisfying.\nNice, what kind of bow?

{"context": "I spend a lot of time on the internet. Probably too much. How about yourself?\nI do too, almost all day because of work and then some, its crazy how dependant weve become of the internet.\nI agree. Did you know that the three horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?\nNo idea it was called like that, what I did know is that you can get signal on top of Mount Everest.\nThat is very shocking. I can't imagine that there are towers anywhere close. Apparently the library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case the internet burns down. I can't imagine how much storage that would take.\nIt must take quite a bit and its refreshing to know there is backup in that library, would you imgaine the consequences of the internet being down?\nIt was be a national emergency at this point.

It's wild to think how nature can outperform human-made music in pure entertainment value.", "Absolutely, nature's symphonies can be astonishing. Lyrebirds are like avian impressionists, and it's refreshing, certainly different than what we sometimes endure in pop culture entertainment.", "Those birds are fascinating! Their mimicry is an intriguing form of communication. I'd choose the natural concert over a disappointing band performance any day.", "True, lyrebirds are amazing.

Invertebrate refers to an animal that doesn't have a spine or backbone\nOK! So how do shell fish breed? What do they feed on?\nThey are mostly filter feeders.

And how do they reproduce, do they lay eggs or give live birth?", "Oh I see, does their filter feeding help clean the water too, then?", "Interesting! Are all shellfish similarly equipped to feed that way, or do some have different diets?", "So they play a role in the ecosystem as cleaners! Can you tell me about their breeding habits?"]}

Just weigh the benefits against the stress before you decide.", "Perhaps you could negotiate for better work-life balance? More vacation time or flexible hours?", "Do you think the stress will be short-term? Sometimes initial challenges ease with time.", "Totally get it.

Apparently a single google search uses more computing power than sending Armstrong and 11 others to the moon\nThat is absolutely crazy. I guess that is why google's data center uses about.01% of all total worldwide electricity\nIt would explain a lot. It once went down for about 5 minutes.

I missed that strong emotional bond.\nYes theres that too. I wish I could say I understand but I don't, I have a little brother.\nI would imagine your relationship with your brother is a very unique one.

Not sure I could deal with that commute, but yes we definitely all need some time to be in our own heads", "candidates": ["The commute is indeed long, but podcasts and audiobooks help. Maybe finding a comforting routine can also ease your mind during your solitude?", "Yeah, the right balance of solitude and company is important.

They are constantly running around too.\nI think that is the role of the parent to teach how to love reading, sometime the school accomplishes the opposite by forcing them to read.\nTrue. The trick with my two is to find something that they enjoy reading so it doesn't feel like a punishment.

Did you know there hasn't been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853?\nNo I didn't know that. That seems like a long time, what do you think about the fact that back in 1805 the runner-up in the presidential election would become the vice president, that seems like it would create all kinds of problems today\nOh for sure, never work now!!

Is the news in Latin in Canada also 40% canadians?", "candidates": ["Haha, not quite. The Canadian content regulations apply to music, not news. News coverage focuses on local and global events without such rules.", "No, the news rules are different. They're primarily focused on ensuring timely and accurate information, regardless of the origin.", "I'm not sure about news in Latin, but Canadian regulations focus more on music to support Canadian artists.

Actually, one of my favorite hobbies is going out and hunting. I hunt deer and use every part of the carcass somehow.\nThats fantastic. I really enjoy fishing.

Also a really good movie!\nAnd he was awesome in that! Such a cool movie I agree. He has been in so many it seems.\nYeah, he's made quite a name for himself. Gene Wilder (who apparently wasn't such a big fan of Depp) refused to watch the remake of willy wonka for fear of being disappointed by him.\nI never heard about that, Gene was so good, I am a bit surprised by that.\nI am too. Do you use Netflix?", "candidates": ["Yes, I have a Netflix subscription. It's great for discovering films I might not have watched otherwise. How about you?", "I do, but I've been binge-watching shows more than movies lately. Found any good series on Netflix recently?", "I used to, but not anymore. I'm more of a Hulu person now because they have a different selection. What about you?", "No, I don't actually. I find it hard to keep up with all the streaming services.

But I've never found a tomato to be poisonous!\nYou mentioned Peru. Don't they eat Guinea pigs there? Doesn't say much for their taste in foods.\nActually, that must be a myth or misconception. The four traditional foods Peruvians eat are legumes, quinoa, potatoes, and corn!", "candidates": ["Interesting point about dosage. I\u2019ll be more careful with my tomato intake!", "You're right about the traditional foods; I must have mixed things up.

It gives a whole new perspective to the show.", "No way, that's a fun fact! It's kind of like recycling in the entertainment industry. I wonder if there are Easter eggs too?"]}

We'll have to innovate to tackle that challenge.", "1977 was the start of an era with Star Wars! Speaking of eras ending, the helium shortage will force science to adapt quickly.

Mexican is probably his favorite, but he also likes wings.\nMexican is delicious. I also enjoy food from Israel. Anything with hummus is good in my book. Have you had falafel or couscous?\nYes both of those and love them - hummus is also a staple in our home.\nI love how cuisines can spread around the world. What started in the middle east has now traveled over to our part of the world. It's delicious! I love when hummus is made with salt and garlic. What do you like it with?", "candidates": ["I'm all about the classic hummus - a touch of lemon juice and tahini. Sometimes I'll mix in roasted red peppers for a bit of a twist!", "Hummus with pita is the go-to, but I\u2019ll sprinkle some pine nuts or add a dash of paprika to switch it up.", "We usually have it plain, but I love it with olive oil and za'atar. It\u2019s such a simple, flavor-packed combination.", "For me, it's all about texture, so I add extra chickpeas on top for a crunchy twist to the usual creamy hummus."]}

No, I haven't, but it sounds intriguing. Is it less luck-based than Monopoly?", "I'm not familiar with Web and Starship. What's the gameplay like?

It is also so hard to believe he received no scholarship offers from any major conference school!\nThat is shocking, didnt he end up at Davidson?\nYes I think so. He has come a long way since then, even declining a sponsorship from Nike because they forgot to delete another players name from the slide.", "candidates": ["Absolutely astonishing.

He's resting now, and we're encouraging him to see a cardiologist soon.", "Definitely. We're trying to get him on a healthier diet and more exercise once he's feeling better.", "I know, it's a wake-up call for all of us to take better care of ourselves.", "He'll pull through; he's a fighter. We just need to make some lifestyle changes, I guess."]}

Did you ever watch House MD?\nYa I've seen tht before, I like Hugh Laurie no one could play the role like he did, I'm glad he makes 700k an episode he deserves it haha\nYeah he did such an amazing job for sure, great show too. Do you like JIm Carrey?\nHe's ok, I liked him in the 90's but I don't think hes made a good movie in a while, you?\nWell he said that he will not do dramas anymore because they do not display positivity\nYa, I never thought those were his best movies personally, did you like Michael Caine? I liked him in austin powers 3 haha\nYeah he is a great actor. Do you know why he decided to become an actor?\nHaha ya I think he was chasing girls! All the cutest girls were in acting classes so he joined, I can't blame him haha", "candidates": ["Haha, classic reason to start acting! Have you ever done anything unexpected just to be closer to a crush or interest?", "That's a pretty hilarious and honest reason to get into acting. Speaking of Michael Caine, which of his more serious roles do you like?", "Michael Caine certainly had his priorities! Have you seen him in \"The Italian Job\" or \"The Dark Knight\"? He's brilliant in those.", "Chasing girls into acting classes seems to have paid off for him. Have you ever joined a club or taken up a hobby just to meet people?"]}

You?\nJust doing alright. Getting ready for work. Got big dreams.", "candidates": ["What kind of work do you do? And what are those big dreams you're chasing?", "Glad to hear you're doing okay! What's your dream job, or the goal you're working towards?", "Big dreams sound intriguing! Care to share more about them?", "It's always exciting to have goals.

{"context": "My kids wouldn't clean their room yesterday. I was quite displeased.\nOh no, I hope you pardon them.\nI shan't! I will put them up for adoption on the morrow!", "candidates": ["That seems a bit extreme, maybe there's another way to handle the situation?", "You're joking, right? There's got to be a less drastic solution!", "Perhaps it's just frustration speaking. Shall we brainstorm some discipline strategies?", "I hope that's hyperbole. Kids can be trying, but they learn from consequences, not abandonment."]}
{"context": "I started back dancing ballet. I enjoyed it when I was younger and wanted to get back into it.\nBallet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance. How popular do you feel it is today?\nI think it is still popular, however, it is not as mainstream as it used to be. It seems to be enjoyed by people who enjoy fine arts.\nInteresting, ballet seems to have passed the test of time to this point at least. It certainly is still good to practice for an activity. Do you feel that it's hard to get back into?\nThankfully, I am still flexible and my ankles are strong. But I do have to recondition my feet. When we jump on pointe, we carry 3 times our body weight on the big toes\nThat certainly sounds like it takes good physique to accomplish. Ballet's typically include choreography and music for production; is there any type of music that you prefer for your practice?\nThank you! And yes, any classical music works, but I enjoy Ellina Akimova's compositions!\nInteresting, that sounds like fun! What about training, do you think there's a specific music that enables you to focus more while practicing? Or is it purely for the performance (not affecting your ability)?", "candidates": ["Absolutely, for training, I prefer softer classical pieces that allow me to concentrate on technique without getting distracted by heavy rhythms or lyrics.", "I like to mix it up; sometimes I use upbeat contemporary music for stamina training and sometimes silence to focus on my form and breathing.", "For focusing, I actually sometimes prefer ambient sounds or minimalistic music to help me concentrate on the movements rather than the melody.", "Yes, something with a clear beat helps me maintain tempo during practice, but it's less about the style and more about the rhythm and how it matches the exercise."]}
{"context": "One Direction\nI like them too. What is your favorite song?\nMy favourite is up all night and take me home\nWho is your favorite? I like Harry.\nHarry is cool, but I like Louis.\nHe's my second favorite. Do you have any pets?\nI have a cat. He is fat and lazy, but I love him.\nAw, I love cats. I have 3 dogs.", "candidates": ["Wow, three dogs must keep you busy! What breed are they?", "Dogs are great companions. Do they get along with cats?", "That's a full house!

{"context": "Good morning! How are you today?\nHi how are you? I'm good\nI'm doing well! Are you a fan of football at all?\nI sometimes watch. I try to watch the super bowl.\nThis year it was so boring! It was even more boring to know that only 11 minutes of live gameplay happened in it haha.\nI think the game was better the previous year. A big comeback at the end. 11 minutes? Yeah, it seems too short. But there is so much violence, people love it.", "candidates": ["You're right, last year's game had a thrilling finish. They say the violence draws fans, but for me, it's all about the strategy and skill.", "Definitely, the excitement comes from those intense moments. Do you have a favorite team, or do you just enjoy the game itself?", "The violence can be a bit much, I agree. Do you think the rules should change to make it safer?", "For sure, the comeback was epic. I also think the halftime show adds a lot to the experience.

{"context": "My friend is a fan of the Detroit Red Wings. I really dont know much about them.\nMy dad is from Detroit! He made me become a fan of them, even though we live in Boston.

Although funnily enough, they were just the Detroit Cougars until after 1930.", "candidates": ["That's interesting! Despite living in Boston, you must have seen some intense rivalry games with the Bruins! How does your family handle that?", "The Detroit Cougars, huh? I didn't know that. Ever been to a game in Detroit?", "So, they've been around for almost a century! Must be cool to support a team with such history. Got a favorite Red Wings memory?", "I see, not a love at first sight then. What changed your mind about them, any particular player or winning season?"]}
{"context": "Careful, I understand there are some real legal pitfall with those crowd sourcing sights\nYeah definitely!\nYou just never know who you can trust.\nYes, no doubt about that! I do worry about privacy issues!\nNot all are bad though.

Maybe it's all the time that I spend with the horses\nHaha, could be. I like pizza myself although I have no horses to feed.", "candidates": ["Pizza is always a good choice. Do you have a favorite topping or pizza place you'd recommend?", "Horses do have good taste! Pizza\u2019s versatile, perfect for a quick meal or a social gathering. Tried any unusual toppings?", "Haha, pizza pairs well with almost anything. Ever tried making it from scratch? It's quite fun!", "Interesting how our favorites are so different! Have you ever mixed it up and tried a pizza with an oatmeal crust?"]}
{"context": "How's it going? Pretty interesting some writers thought The Pats could beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl without Rob Gronkowski\nHi how are you? Im doing great. The Pats won this time against LA, right? I didnt watch the game.\nYea this year but last year they lost to eagles, even with Rob Gronkowski playing the entire game\nThe bowl last year was pretty good. There was a big comeback at the end, right?\nI think there were quite a few lead changes throughout the game and I believe it was Brady's 8th super bowl apperance\nHe has six rings now? The man is a legend. He is not my favorite, but I understand why people like him.\nYea, he's accomplished a lot which is pretty amazing considering he was drafted in the sixth round of the draft\nNobody really understood his potential. And with Bill, he has found his place. Those two have a few years left.\nYea, Brady has really grown with Bill and really advanced in 2007 when he threw for 50 tds that season", "candidates": ["Fifty touchdowns in one season is monstrous. Hard to imagine anyone breaking that record anytime soon. Bill definitely knows how to use his talent.", "2007 was his peak, but he's remained consistent. It's rare to see that longevity in sports.", "It's crazy how some athletes just click with a coach. Brady and Belichick really are the perfect match.", "Gronkowski and Brady had some connection, huh?

{"context": "My job can annoy me sometimes, people always have issues\nThat's always a bad thing about having to work with others. What kind of issues do they have?\nJust issues with technology", "candidates": ["Oh, tech problems can be such a headache. Are you part of IT support, or is it more about guiding people through standard tech use?", "Yeah, tech can be so fickle. Do you find it more software issues or hardware troubles?", "That's tough. Is it because they're not tech-savvy, or are the systems just not user-friendly?", "I can only imagine. What's the most common tech issue that comes up?"]}
{"context": "I really enjoy going SCUBA diving with my spouse. It is so much fun to be able to breathe underwater and explore.\nIt sounds really fun. But I've always wondered. What does scuba stand for?\nSCUBA stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. People usually take compressed gas with them.\nI think I learned that from boy meets world, but forgot. Haha.\nThat was a great show! When you are SCUBA diving, an open circuit system lets the breathing gas go into the environment as you breathe out. It's a fascinating system.\nHow long can a person stay under water when diving?\nIt really depends on a lot of factors like how much air is in your tank as well as how deep you go. For instance, you may run out in an hour or less time if you dive deeper. You need to learn a lot of skills before you go.", "candidates": ["So, the deeper you go, the less time you have. Does deeper diving require special training?", "Interesting. Are there any signs that warn you when you're running low on air, or do you just check the gauge?", "What happens if you run out of air underwater? Is there an emergency protocol?", "That's cool! Have you ever encountered any dangerous situations while diving with your spouse?"]}

I am a meat lover.", "candidates": ["I had a steak earlier, it was delicious. But that shadow really distracted me from my meal's afterglow.", "Well, I grilled some chicken for dinner. It\u2019s strange how mundane things like eating can turn eerie so quickly with something like that happening.", "I'm a vegetarian, so I had a veggie stir-fry. Still, seeing that shadow was unnerving, especially in my own kitchen.", "I had pasta, nothing too fancy. I haven\u2019t been able to shake off the chill from seeing that shadow. It's made the whole house feel different."]}
{"context": "Hi! Did you know that amazon is the largest internet retailer in the world?\nYeah pretty cool. Wouldn't want to work in the warehouses though and walk 15 miles a day.\nTrue, but it would be great exercise! Just think, amazon started as an online bookstore and now look at it!\nYeah, Bezos has enough money to build a clock into a mountain that runs for 10,000 years.\nThat is so odd! I wonder why he did that.\nNo idea. Netflix is another internet success story. They make up 33% of internet bandwidth in the evenings.", "candidates": ["Wow, 33%? That's massive. Netflix really changed how we watch TV. Makes you wonder what's next for internet entertainment, huh?", "That's crazy dominance by Netflix. Have you seen their original content? Some shows are really top-notch!", "33%, seriously? Just shows how streaming has taken over. Do you have any favorite Netflix series?", "Netflix using a third of bandwidth is wild. Do you think streaming services will eventually replace traditional TV?"]}

My siblings are taking them for free so I'm not mad at them but I'm definitely mad at my brother and sister! They didn't say a thing, even when I mentioned it.", "candidates": ["That's incredibly unfair. Have you tried asking your brother and sister why they left you out?", "Ouch, that's harsh. How do you plan to confront them about this?", "That must hurt a lot. Do you think there's a misunderstanding, or was it intentional?", "Wow, that's really insensitive of them. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?"]}
{"context": "Some people don't like texting but I am one who prefers texting over talking on the phone.\nWhat do you prefer about texting over talking?\nI am just not a talker and be very busy so the communication to my family and friends using messages is much more complex.\nThat makes sense. Do you think emotions or context gets lost over text messages?\nYes a lot of times even when I receive certain text I be like wait is this suppose to be a inappropriate message or is my mom mad at or me or think I am being impolite. So it does have some down falls.\nDoes your entire family text more than talk on the phone?\nYes they do it is much more convenient my mother in law even text us from her tablet, some times I do feel the lack of conversation comes in from text at times but the business of everyone it is convenient.", "candidates": ["Have you ever thought about using emojis or GIFs to add context to your texts and reduce misunderstandings?", "Since convenience can cost us some depth in conversation, do you sometimes arrange phone calls for more serious topics?", "Do you find that social media helps to keep a better emotional connection with your family than texting does?", "How about using voice messages? They can be quick like texts but carry tone and emotion better."]}

He was born in 1988.\nSuch a young player! He makes the 5th highest salary on his team as well!\nWow, that makes sense since many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.\nDid you know in 2014-15 season, he won the MVP?\nYes I actually did,because he led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975!", "candidates": ["That's quite an achievement.

It can go the other way, Earth moves between the sun and moon, but it's less impressive.\nDo you know how often these solar eclipses happen?", "candidates": ["Actually, solar eclipses happen roughly every 18 months somewhere on Earth, but seeing a total eclipse at any given location is rare, maybe once in a lifetime.", "I'm not exactly sure, but I've read that total solar eclipses in the same spot can happen about every 360 to 410 years.", "They're not that common; full solar eclipses in a particular area can happen centuries apart, but partial ones are more frequent.", "Not too often in one place, but a solar eclipse of some kind happens every one to two years around the world.

I haven't seen the film though.\nSpeaking of clothing, the Director, Brad Bird, voiced the character Edna Mode, who just so happens to be the superhero costume designer in the film!\nYeah, I heard that Bird voiced Edna during storyboarding sessions. The production team couldn't find an actress who could do the voice better than him.\nThat's kind of funny, isn't it?

I love sci-fi entertainment! What other books has Orson Scott written?\nHe wrote \"Speaker for the Dead\" in 1986. Both novels won Hugo and Nebula Awards.", "candidates": ["That's impressive! Winning both awards is no small feat. Are there more books in that series?", "Speaker for the Dead\" must be good if it won those awards. Does it continue Ender's story", "Those awards are big in the sci-fi world, right? What are some themes Orson Scott Card explores in his works?", "It's rare for a sequel to be so well received!

Have any other comedies you hold in that high regard?", "Really? I can see why, it's a classic. It mixes humor with action so well. What's your favorite scene?", "I didn't know Bill Murray had said that. It's interesting to hear what comedians think about other comedy works. Do you agree with his opinion?", "Bill Murray has a great sense of humor, so that's quite the endorsement! I'd love to hear what other movies comedians find hilarious."]}

I used to work in cable tech, I know what I'm doing.\nWell it looks like they fixed it!", "candidates": ["Yeah, they finally did, but only after I escalated the issue to a supervisor. It shouldn't be that hard.", "They did, but I shouldn\u2019t have to fight for a simple service call. I shouldn't have to prove my knowledge for help.", "Turns out, a neighbor's issue affected my line.

{"context": "I don't think pit bulls are aggressive. I would like to adopt one\nI guess it depends on how their raised, they do have fighting in their blood as they were originally developed as fighting dogs.\nReally? I didn't know that. Is dog fighting legal?\nNo it is illegal in the US, though still exists in the underground world.\nHow sad :( I don't understand how can people enjoy seeing other animals fight?\nI don't know, they must be sick people, and they do it for the money too. I know pit bulls are a common breed in dog fighting rings, probably why people associate them with aggressiveness.\nThat breaks my heart. Pit bulls are so beautiful\nThey are quite majestic, it's interesting how the term pit bull is often used loosely to describe different breeds of dogs with similar physical characteristics sometimes.", "candidates": ["So true, it's unfair to judge them all based on the actions of a few. How can someone tell if a dog is a true pit bull or just a mix?", "That's enlightening. What can people do to change this negative perception of pit bulls?", "I'll make sure to educate others on this issue. It's important for the good of the breed. Any recommendations on where to adopt one?", "Exactly, the stigma is based on misinformation. Maybe if more responsible owners share their positive stories, the breed's image could improve."]}

Our town only has about 1000 people in it, and we're at least a half hour away from the next town.\nI see. Rural areas are usually defined as a geographic area outside towns and cities. I am just outside the main city but you are more rural than me!\nI'd say. We're one of those stereotypical towns where we have more cows than people. Even worse, no Taco Bell or pizza delivery!\nYes, agricultural areas such as yours are common in rural settlements.

It could be a lower-cost start-up option and would be a hit with the locals!", "Maybe there's a grant or local program to support new businesses in rural areas.

Each has its own strengths. Deadpool is my favorite, but I also admire DC's legacy characters like Superman.", "It's hard to choose.

Why are you scared of them?\nI do thou like enjoy frog legs.", "candidates": ["Wow, that's quite a contrast! Is it the way they look that scares you, but the taste is worth it?", "Interesting, so it's more of a visual or presence-related fear rather than a complete aversion. How do you reconcile the two feelings?", "That's intriguing! How do you manage to handle them when it comes to eating frog legs?", "So you're scared of live frogs, but not when it comes to food.

Since there isn't any standard equipment, people can spend hundreds of dollars on just one club - that you might use 8 - 15 times per game!\nYeah, and all that use might be on one hole, in one sand trap! At least that has been my experience! You know who the wealthiest three presidents were?\nI don't. I would guess Trump is one, but don't know who the other two are.", "candidates": ["Actually, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were quite wealthy because of their extensive landholdings.

George Washington had a fortune with his plantation, and Thomas Jefferson, despite debt issues, owned vast estates. A different era, but still loaded.", "Trump is wealthy, that's true. George Washington and John F. Kennedy came from affluent families as well. Different times, but their wealth was substantial.", "Trump is well-off for sure.

I do not like hearing the audience laugh, I feel like I should know when something is funny\nI agree\nSometimes they use a live audience, but somethimes it seems very fake or canned\nEven live they tell the audience when to laugh\nExactly, apparently, they started using them in the late 1950s, Charles Douglass invented the laugh track\nThat why I like todays movies", "candidates": ["You're right; newer movies often skip the laugh track. It's refreshing when filmmakers trust the audience to know when to laugh.", "Yeah, today's comedies tend to rely more on situational humor without forcing laughter. It allows for more genuine reactions.", "That's true. Modern films often aim for a more natural feel. It makes the humor feel more personal and less scripted.", "Good point. I think movies without laugh tracks offer a more authentic experience. It's nice to decide for ourselves when something is funny."]}

He is really excited and a little nervous. But I still feel like I need to live up to him, even though he says I don't.\nDon't compare yourself to him.

Do you know anything else about the Violin?\nI know there's different ways to play it, like pizzicato which is plucking the strings.", "candidates": ["Right, pizzicato! There's also bowing techniques like spiccato and vibrato that give it a unique sound. Ever been to a live orchestra performance to hear it?", "Exactly, plucking the strings gives a different texture of sound. There's a whole world of techniques, like using different bow pressures and positions.", "Pizzicato is cool, and there's legato where you play long and smooth notes. Have you heard of any famous violinists? Like Itzhak Perlman or Hilary Hahn?", "True, pizzicato adds a nice touch. Violins have been key in many musical eras. It's amazing how versatile they are, from classical to folk music. Have you got a favorite music genre?"]}

I think things that are red seem to just taste better.\nSo pizza is perfect for you, red sauce, pepperoni, red peppers...", "candidates": ["Absolutely! Adding some red peppers would make it a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds.", "Haha, that's right! Red peppers would kick it up a notch. Maybe I'll try your combo next time.", "Red peppers do sound like a great addition, but I hope they don't overpower the pineapple's sweetness.", "True, that would complement the theme.

I have not seen it but I know it was critically acclaimed. Especially the songs, and the lead actors liked each other. What was bad about it?\nWell I was watching it and it's very unrealistic, AND it's boring, like nothing happens, I didn't think the songs were good, it takes a lot for me to stop watching a movie but man I thought it was really bad, I know lady gaga is in it and I guess her favorite band is Iron Maiden, which is completely not her style of music haha\nAhh that's interesting. I've heard a lot of critcisms about the music too. For example, the songs \"Why Did You Do That?\" and \"Hair Body Face\" don't even make sense as titles.\nNope when you hear it out of context the names definitely seem weird, I do like Elton john though, did you know that he chose lady gaga as his son's godmother?\nWow, I would've guessed there was too big of a gap between them to know each other! Although there's a lot more to Lady Gaga, she was actually on MTV's \"Boiling Points\" even before being famous.", "candidates": ["Unbelievable, right?

Do you know more about regret?\nRegret is related to perceived opportunity, something you may be regretful over is something I may cherish. I like that about regret and emotions in general because it means you can change your outlook on it by changing your persective (sometimes, I dont think it will work for everythng).\nIt's true a perspective change can really help a situation. Do you know a lot about psychology?\nI had a high schools knowledge of psychology but even that has faded away. I loved psychology though especially cognitive psychology! But little fact about regret is in western socities adults have the highest regrets regarding their choice in education, so when making academic decisions choose wisely!\nWow I had no idea, I can understand though since I regret my own education decisions. Can you tell me more about cognitive psychology?\nCognitive psychology is the study of mental processes like attention, language use, perception, memory, problem solving, creativity, and thinking. It studies the brain very heavily. We learn where the parts of our brain that do what are. It is SO interesting.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating! Do you have a favorite area within cognitive psychology that you find particularly engaging or surprising?", "I've heard of cognitive distortions before.

I'm not sure that I like knowing he lets his kids drink wine though.\nYeah, if that's how you judge whether or not your kids are \"mature\" by whether or not they drink wine, I think he needs a reality check. You think social services would be alerted by that statement?\nI think if it were a non celebrity they would be all over it but because it is Lebron James they will ignore it. I know he says his kids are mature but drinking is not necessarily due to mental maturity. There are physical effects too.\nYeah, I agree. If they drink at that young of an age, I wonder whether or not they'll think Trader Joes cheap wines are disgusting or I wonder whether that statement will come back to bite them for when his kids want to play for the NBA\nOh that's a good point. Coaches may think the kids are alcoholics and not draft them. I wonder too if he'll have his daughter drinking. She's only three right now.\nOh my goodness, well there definitely would be some mental issues if he lets them drink at that young of an age! Seems like he's an avid drinker because he gave up wine for two weeks in preparation for the Lakers but commented that it made him want wine even more. Or did the article misspell whine", "candidates": ["It's concerning if his love for wine overshadows his judgment as a parent. It's one thing to enjoy a drink, another to normalize it for children.", "He might be joking about wanting wine, but it raises questions. Will kids follow that path?", "Giving up wine for two weeks isn't much. Being a role model is about setting consistent, healthy examples, not just short-term changes.", "The media always twists words, but if he's genuinely craving alcohol, that's a problem, especially with young kids watching."]}

But Japan is definitely on my bucket list. What's the occasion for the trip?", "Indeed, I've been to a few places in Europe. Traveling is refreshing! You'll have an amazing time in Japan.", "I wish! Never had the chance to travel abroad, but Japan would be a dream. Make sure you try authentic sushi there!"]}
{"context": "I went to Oklahoma University. Are you familiar with Baker Mayfield?\nNo, I don't know much about football. Is he a football player\nYes. He won the Heisman Trophy last year. He is mentioned in Section 2. He now plays for Cleveland Browns\nConcussions can be serious I understand. Seems like now the football players have to be taken to the locker room for concussion evals if unable to stand or falls after being hit in the head.\nYes! And it's about time. I have a Pastor who used to play in the NFL. He now has CTE and has donated his brain for study after his death.\nWow. Newton had an abrasion over his right eye from his hit. Evaluation for a concussion requires analysis now of a broadcast video and an exam by a medical team familiar with the player\nYes. There was controversy about that injury. He is a tough QB and has some major collisions. It seems he was handled properly.\nDid you know that the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record players every move on the field\nNo. That is news to me. But it seems like good use of technology. It is a multi-billion dollar sport so it is worth the investment.\nJust seems a bit robotic to me though. Did you know that Tom Brady was picked 199th in the 2000 nfl draft", "candidates": ["Hard to believe such a legendary career started at 199th, goes to show the draft isn't everything.", "Brady's a testament to perseverance. Draft numbers aren't the be-all and end-all of a player's potential.", "Wow, that's inspiring! Proves you can't judge a player's future success just by their draft pick.", "That's incredible. Brady's career really defies expectations, reminding us that late-round picks can become legends too."]}

He sounds like he's busy with such a big family.", "candidates": ["Indeed, it's always bustling here, but we manage. Hobbies help; I love painting in my little spare time.", "Yeah, it's challenging, but we make it work. Luckily, my parents often help out with the kids.", "He's dedicated, for sure. I sometimes wish for more family time, but we cherish the moments we get.", "That's true, his job's demanding. We try to plan family activities during the weekends to catch up."]}

It's amazing how immersive the experience can be nowadays with all the advancements in sound and picture quality!", "That's exciting! You'll be amazed by the comfy reclining seats some theaters have now. Do you guys have a movie picked out already?", "Awesome! Don't forget to try the new flavors of popcorn they have. It's not just about the film; it's about the whole experience! Have fun!", "Movies have really changed! Be prepared for some high-tech screening with 3D and IMAX options. It makes the story come alive like never before. What genre are you into?"]}

I like unique pictures that are taken candidly to express beauty in the world.\nHave you ever seen the photo that is believed to be the first using camera obscura image projection?\nI don't know what camera obscura image prediction is. I mainly take photos with a digital camera or with a phone camera.\nMy son had a photography class that had a unit on obscura. Obscura is Latin for \"dark room\". You might know it better as a \"pinhole\" camera.\nOh no I've never used a dark room although I have always wanted to. I've done a little research and learned that the equipment for this method is quite expensive.\nYou can actually make a pinhole camera with a Principles can. Very easily. They work best when it's dark. We made them as kids and took pictures of the constellations.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating! Do you have any of those childhood photos or a guide on how to make a pinhole camera?", "A homemade pinhole camera seems like a fun DIY project. How does the picture quality compare to modern cameras?", "Interesting, I\u2019ll look into making one. Do you need special paper for the pictures, or can you use regular photographic paper?", "I love DIY projects, making a pinhole camera sounds cool! Is it hard to capture clear images of something as detailed as constellations?"]}

What field are you looking in?\nI have background in social services case management", "candidates": ["I see. Have you considered looking into nonprofit organizations? They often need people with case management skills.", "Social services are vital. Perhaps you could tap into local government job openings?", "That's a crucial field! Maybe you can find remote opportunities for case management that would broaden your search?", "Tough times, but don't give up. Have you thought about further training to boost your employability in social services?"]}
{"context": "Hi there, are you into fashion at all?\nNot that much although I wonder what Miguel Cabarllo's bulletproof clothing looks like\nMe either. I try to stay trendy and I appreciate the artistic side. What is cool is that humans decided at some point that clothing is necessary and we are the only species to do it.\nYea, although people like the Greeks didn't make the smartest fashion choices by putting asbestos into their clothing", "candidates": ["Wow, that asbestos fact is wild. It makes you think about how fashion has evolved not just stylistically, but also in terms of safety and health. ", "The Greeks definitely had a unique perspective, not realizing the health risks! Makes you appreciate modern material science.", "True, kind of ironic how something meant for protection could be so dangerous. Thank goodness for advancements in non-toxic fabrics!", "Yeah, it's fascinating, and a bit scary, how ancient fashion trends could be harmful. It's a relief we now understand the importance of safe textiles."]}

I am taking her on vacation someday.\nWill your wife cook for me?\nIf you'll let my father who is a driver sleep on your couch tomorrow", "candidates": ["Sure, but does your father snore? I need my beauty sleep too, you know!", "Only if he doesn't mind a lumpy couch, deal?", "That'll be fine, as long as he can handle a cat that loves to cuddle with couch guests.", "Sounds fair, but he better have some good road stories to share!"]}
{"context": "I'm pretty excited about this new Spider-Man game on PS4.\nI see you are a PS4 fan\nYeah. I have an xbox too, but I slightly prefer ps more.", "candidates": ["What are the features you like better about the PS4 over the Xbox when playing games like Spider-Man?", "That's fair, do you find the PS4 exclusives like Spider-Man sway your preference?", "So, does the controller or the user interface have a role in your preference for PS4?", "Interesting! Are you planning to upgrade to a PS5 to keep up with the newest games, or are you sticking with the PS4 for now?"]}

Its a 24/7 job. My kids go to camp for a month starting next week. It will be interesting with no children.\nA times one could be desperate as the Desperate Housewives is an American television comedy-drama series..Lol!\nLol, yes, I have seen it. It seems a little fake to me.", "candidates": ["Totally, reality is often not as dramatic. Enjoy the peace and quiet next week!", "Fake or not, it's entertaining. What plans do you have while the kids are away?", "I hear you! Real housework is less glamorous. Maybe use the time for some self-care?", "Exactly, it's much more demanding in real life.

Swimming might be a healthier hobby for me, huh?", "Video games and swimming, quite the balance! I play sometimes but mostly puzzle games on my phone. Ever tried those?"]}
{"context": "Have you ever visited the white house\nI have not, have you? I hears the president guest house is bigger than the white house.\nI went there one time. I never saw the guest house, I wonder why they made it bigger?\nMaybe so more people could stay in it. Thats really cool you got to see it, how much is it to visit?\nIt was more at the gates lol. That was good enough for me. Apparently there is twin white houses in other countires\nYeah I forget which counties. The president of indonesia has 3 pop albums!\nI think it is France and Ireland. I think our current president needs a pop album, I would like him more lol", "candidates": ["A presidential pop album would be quite a shift! Maybe it'd be a hit. But really, those twin White Houses must be fascinating to see.", "Lol, imagine a presidential pop tour! On a separate note, it's interesting how architecture can be replicated. The French and Irish versions must have stories behind them.", "Ha, I'd definitely listen to our president's pop debut. On a different topic, it's so intriguing how different countries draw inspiration from the White House!", "If our president dropped an album, that would be one for the history books! And I\u2019m curious about those twin White Houses. Maybe they're diplomatic gestures?"]}

What's your band's name, and do you have any gigs coming up?", "Wow, a grunge band! How do you balance teaching school, band practice, and performances?", "That's so cool! What inspired you and your sister to start a grunge band?", "Grunge, huh? Must be a fun throwback to the '90s! Do you write your own songs?"]}

I just don't understand why people can't just be kind and good and instead want to hurt and destroy\nSome people are only out for themselves unfortunately.", "candidates": ["You're right, it's like a constant battle for power or something. Why can't we work towards common goals?", "It's exhausting. How do you handle it when you're faced with those kinds of people?", "I agree, and it makes trust so hard to build. Any tips for dealing with it?", "It seems so, and it affects mental health a lot. What helps you stay positive in such situations?"]}

I just will get a list of chicken dishes\nI like them too, I really like chicken red meat instead of white meat, its more tasty\nChicken meals can come with a wide viriety of foods and cooked many different ways\nYes, I really like the south-american style, the chicken is pulled and mixed with a lot of juicy dressings\nYes, Chicken is one of the most common meat dish in the middle age as well\nYes, the chicken is easy to grow, and gives a lot of protein to a human body, also it gives eggs :D\nYes there are a lot of season and ingredients of chicken dishes that insure you get what is needed\nYes, have you tried chicken-parmesan its the best chicken dish for me, really tasty :D", "candidates": ["Chicken Parmesan sounds amazing!

Sometimes I like to keep it simple with a classic roast chicken.", "Oh, Chicken Parmesan is a classic! I love experimenting with Asian-inspired glazes on grilled chicken too.

I dis not want to pursue the career of working in a bank like my father,", "candidates": ["It's important to follow your own path. Do you find the subject matter for your masters compelling?", "I can understand that. Banking isn't for everyone. What made you choose teaching?", "That's quite a shift from banking to teaching.

{"context": "Hello! Are you a basketball fan?\nYou bet. NBA. Have liked Steph Curry since 2015 win over Cavs.\nThat was the year he won the MVP wasn't it?\nYes, the 1st yr. He won it. Think he won it again in 2016 by unanimous vote.\nThe Golden State Warriors set the all time NBA record for wins in 2016 and ironically...that's the year they lost to the Cavs! Lol\nI know. But they came back to NBA Finals in 2017 and 2018 to win back-to-back titles. Impressive!\nDefinitely! Could you imagine if they beat the Cavs in 2016? That would have been one heck of a title streak. Did you know that Stephen Curry was born in Akron, Ohio?\nDidn't know. Could call it Acrid, OH. Think he's only 30- a lot of great years yet, I hope.\nLol I'm surprised that in his MVP year of 2015 he had only the 5th highest salary on the team.", "candidates": ["Yeah, salary rankings don't always reflect a player's value or talent. Good management, I guess. They got a steal with Curry!", "It's pretty common in sports, right? Sometimes the best players don't top the pay list until they renegotiate. Curry's contract had humble beginnings.", "That just shows salary isn't everything. Curry's skill outshone his paycheck, proving his worth far exceeded his earnings at the time.", "Surprising, isn't it? But that MVP season really catapulted him to stardom, and his salary eventually caught up with his performance."]}

Have you found any way to connect with people over there?", "An empty hostel could be a good opportunity to enjoy some quiet time. Are you planning to do any sightseeing?", "I get that. Being alone in a foreign place can be hard. How much longer will you be traveling?"]}
{"context": "Wedding cakes are traditional cakes served at weddings\nI love cakes.\nSame here. Have you ever tried a fruit cake? Typicall its made with candied or dried fruits\nYes, I eat it during Christmas.\nGood time to have fruit cake. Another fact is that in the united kingdom, rich versions of fruit cake may be iced and decorated.\nI like my fruit cake iced.\nFruit cakes are generally consumed on their own, as opposed with condiments", "candidates": ["Oh, without condiments? I sometimes enjoy them with a bit of cream cheese on top.", "That's interesting. Personally, I've also had it with nuts mixed in; adds a nice crunch.", "True, but have you ever tried warming it up and serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?", "I can understand that. However, I've paired it with a nice cup of tea before, and it was delightful."]}

{"context": "Hey there! Are you interested in poetry at all?\nNot too much, but I know a bit, what about you?\nSame- I think its really amazing that it has such an extensive history though. I was reading a few interesting things about it.

That blows my mind! I can't picture how they would judge it, but it must have been fascinating to see.", "Wow, I had no idea poetry was ever considered for the Olympics. That would've brought a whole different vibe to the games!", "Really? Olympic poetry sounds intriguing. Makes me wonder about the criteria they used for judging and the types of works presented.", "That's so cool! I can't even imagine what an Olympic poetry competition would look like.

How's the second job going? Are you managing okay with the extra hours?", "That's a strong move to pick up a second job. Hope it's not too stressful for you though. Remember to take care of yourself.", "Sorry about your lunch! What kind of job did you find? Is it helping you with your finances so far?", "I admire your drive!

Did he sell the idea to George Foreman?\nIm not sure but I think he did'\nI love to cook sandwiches on my grill", "candidates": ["Yeah, sandwiches are great on it! The ridged plates make for perfect grill marks.", "Sandwiches are just the beginning; it's also excellent for grilling vegetables or making quick burgers.", "That's awesome.

Did you know that our telephones convert sound, mostly our voices, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another phone which reproduces the sounds to the receiving user?\nYes, It is crazy the things they can do also.

Also speaking of phones, did you know that it's impossible to separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped together?\nI have heard that, but havent seen a phone book in ages. If I do ever find two again, I am tempted to give it a go.\nHa, ha, ha, me too. Did you know that the cables carrying the phone and internet data across the oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor?\nYeah, that must have taken a while to set down.\nI agree.

{"context": "I've been on a motorcycle once, it scared me.\nMaybe you should try a motorcycle with three wheel, with a sidecar, it is more stable.\nThat sounds much better to me. Do those have a name?\nIt has different names, an outfit, a rig, a hack or a combination, but all are a motorcycle with a sidecar.\nCool. My uncle has a Harley Davidson, it looks awesome.\nYeah motos can have different looks for different purpose, off-road, cruising or long distance.\nYea my uncle mostly uses his for cruising.\nBut in developing countries they are really popular because they cost less than a car.

{"context": "Have you ever invested in digital currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum?\nNo, I just don't have the money to invest in such a risky venture. The price fluctuates too much for me to see it as an investment. What do you think about digital currencies?\nI have thought about it and like you though it to be too risky. Most experts say the blokchain which the digital currencies are OK. Its the dealers (i.e. The exchanges that get hacked) or as recently happened in Canada, a Bitcoin exchange president died and took the master password with him. I see no backup like the FDIC and traditional banks\nI think that I can trust myself to have my own wallet with my own password, like you I don't trust those companies, they are like sketchy banks, it kind of defeats the purpose of those currencies, getting rid of banks interference.\nTrue, and when they maintain your \"wallet\" on the internet, you have instant access but also the instant risk to hackers. If you go to an offline wallet such as a hard disk at home, then that defeats the purpose of a digital currency. To spend it from an offline wallet you need to physically plug it in - sort of like going to the bank for cash before ATMs and digital transfers. While the internet is great, I am not comfortable with my money floating out there. Do you think they will ever fix it or will with every fix, the hackers will develop a new exploit?\nI think hackers will always find new ways. Especially with digital currencies, banks are the money to hire \"counter-hackers\", digital currecy companies are too small to hire them.\nAgreed, at the same time, some of the risk is on the user end, that is with you and I. We need to practice \"safe computing\". Do you use one type of computer (e.g. Windows) or have different types of devices?\nI have a win 10 desktop and a linux laptop. I also had an old desktop with win 98 on it, it not win 95 but still very old.\nI have Win10, iOS, and Andriod, so that's 3 types of devices with their security issues, security updates, and security software suites. Things have sure gotten more complicated since the days of DOS on 16-bit machines. Did you know that someone built a working 16-bit computer using basic Minecraft building blocks?\nNot I am not surprised, they are building really complex things in Minecraft using switches, it is more than just virtual Legos, but they are useful, the first google computer case was made of Legos.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating about Google's initial use of Legos! Legos or Minecraft, it's all about creativity. Regarding security, though, have you looked into any specific encryption tools or practices for your personal devices?", "True, creativity knows no bounds, whether with Legos or virtual blocks! But on a security note, with your combination of Windows 10 and Linux, how are you managing your cybersecurity?", "Technology's come far from Lego cases to complex Minecraft creations! Speaking of advancements, have you given any thought to how blockchain might change our approach to cybersecurity?", "It's amazing, the ingenuity from Legos to Minecraft. Nonetheless, staying secure online is a different challenge. Have you ever been through a security scare on any of your devices?"]}

You seem cheery, good start to your day?", "Glad to hear that! I'm a bit under the weather, though.", "Oh, I'm fantastic! Just finished a morning jog. Have you been keeping active too?"]}
{"context": "At work, I'm one of the only men around so I tend to take out the heavier trash. Tdoay, the trash bag busted all over me. It was so gross, and I was choking on that sickly sweet trash smell.\nGross! Do you work in a restaurant?\nSort of. I would for a university food service umbrella group thing, but when I'm at different locations that I have to bounce between I'll take out their trash since they're understaffed.", "candidates": ["Oh wow, that sounds like a tough day. Do they provide you with better bags or protective gear, considering you're jumping between locations?", "That's tough, doing the dirty work on top of regular duties. Have you talked to management about getting extra help?", "Yikes, that's not pleasant at all. How do you manage to stay on top of your main responsibilities while handling the extra janitorial tasks?", "That's rough; sorry you had to deal with that. Is there a system in place for these situations or is it just all hands on deck whenever needed?"]}
{"context": "I've really never been kayaking but it looks like so much fun, even moreso than canoeing even though they're similar but distinguished.\nI definitely love kayaking. It is fun to do. I am not sure why the crafts are so different", "candidates": ["Yeah, I'd love to try it and see why people prefer one over the other. Maybe it's the paddling style or the kayak's maneuverability?", "Perhaps the difference is in the design? Kayaks seem more enclosed, which might affect how they handle on the water.", "I think kayaking might offer a more intense workout, with the double-bladed paddle. Could that be it?", "You're right; the differences are intriguing. I'd like to compare them by trying a day out on each craft to really understand the nuances."]}
{"context": "I know but I am so focused on doing a good job that I forget to.\nDo you have a family\nI do. I'm married with two boys.\nOh, I have two boys too. One grown up and one at school.\nMy two are still young; both are in elementary school\nThe drop - off and pickup routine can be tough. Do you work?\nI'm a client relations manager in a bank.\nWow, lots of responsibility! I couldn't do that - need more family time.", "candidates": ["Yes, it's a juggle, but I try to balance it by working flexible hours and sometimes remotely.", "It's challenging for sure, but my partner is a huge help. We manage our schedules to ensure family time.", "Absolutely, the job needs a lot of time, but weekends are strictly for family adventures!", "Fortunately, my bank values work-life balance, so I have a bit of wiggle room to attend school events and such."]}
{"context": "Are you interested in travel, cars, or the President?\nI do. Did you know the three wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. I find it surprising since it's not anyone recent.\nYes, I cannot imagine just how much money all of them had. Must have been astronomical. Since the role of the president is a prominent one, you would think that only very wealthy people would be able to get elected since it takes so much money to get to the Presidential office.\nThat is true. Most probably know people who are wealthy who help with their campaigns and such. Where I grew up, our head of state was Prime Minister not president like most republics.\nCool, I know a lot of cultures have different names for their leaders and many leaders are diverse. Did you know that the President of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office.\nThat is pretty funny. Must have been a cool guy. How about President Banana who was the first president of Zimbabwe? What a name, huh?\nYes, his country's main export was probably bananas. He probably thought that was a compliment.", "candidates": ["Actually, President Banana's name had no relation to the fruit; it's a common surname in the region. And despite the humorous coincidence, Zimbabwe's main exports were minerals and tobacco, not bananas.", "It's a humorous coincidence, for sure, but Canaan Banana's presidency was more complex and his legacy is quite controversial due to legal issues he faced after his term.", "Well, names can be deceiving. Zimbabwe's economy is more based on mining and agriculture than just bananas. Still, it's an unforgettable name for a president!", "Ha, I doubt it was taken as a compliment, given the serious political issues at the time. It's interesting to see how names can inadvertently align with stereotypes or national products."]}

Blessed.", "candidates": ["That sounds amazing! What's it like traveling with someone famous?", "Europe is beautiful! Did you both enjoy the trip? Any favorite spots?", "How delightful!

{"context": "I am impressed by the idea of the Nintendo Switch, it seems really cool and seamless\nI like it too, what is your favorite game?\nI think it is a mix of Zelda, Fortnite, and Splatoon", "candidates": ["Zelda is a classic \u2013 Breath of the Wild? The open world is amazing. How do you feel about the sequel coming?", "Fortnite on the go is great! Do you usually play Battle Royale solo or with friends?", "Splatoon is so much fun, right? Are you excited for the new updates or events they've planned?", "Those are some diverse picks! Do you prefer single-player adventures like Zelda, or the online multiplayer aspect of Fortnite and Splatoon?"]}

Mine is Papa Johns, then Domino's, then Pizza Hut\nThose are all amazing my friend but I like Pizza Hut. You have one there?\nYes, we have many Pizza Hut locations here. There's over 16,000 worldwide.\nOh! I feel dumb. I honest had no idea how many there were. I love the pizza the used to put balsamic on... Mmmm\nWe have so many, pizza delivery is usually 30 minutes or less. Pepperoni is my favorite topping.", "candidates": ["30 minutes is perfect when you're craving a good slice. Ever tried something adventurous on your pizza, like pineapple or jalape\u00f1os?", "Pepperoni is classic! I sometimes go for a Meat Lover's pizza; it's like the ultimate indulgence.", "Yeah, quick delivery is great! Do you also enjoy local pizzerias or just stick to the big chains?", "Pepperoni's solid, but have you ever tried adding extra cheese? It's a game-changer for me!"]}
{"context": "Yves Saint Laurent (brand)\nOh neat! I bought a blouse from eBay before and loved it. I wore it to death! How many categories of items do they make?\nThey're a prominent fashion house known for modern and iconic pieces, like tuxedo jackets for women. But they have a broad range of women's AND men's ready-to-wear products. So we're talking leather goods, shoes, and jewelry, as well as perfume, like I mentioned.\nMy biggest dream is to have a brand in Paris that is as big as Yves Saint Laurent.\nOh man, that would be amazing. Have you ever seen that show Project Runway?\nYes! I love seeing the designs they come up with and seeing the designers feedback.\nMe too! I had never seen it before, I just started watching a couple days ago. I usually watch cooking shows.", "candidates": ["If you're into cooking shows, you might also enjoy 'Great British Bake Off'. It's about baking, but it's super cozy and the creativity is amazing!", "Cooking shows are great for inspiration. Do you have a favorite chef or type of cuisine you like to watch?", "Oh, what cooking shows do you recommend? Maybe I can pick up some presentation skills for my future fashion shows!", "Interesting switch from cooking to fashion! I find that creativity in the kitchen often translates well to creativity in design. Have you found any parallels?"]}
{"context": "Do you watch fox News?\nI try not to, I find them a bit slanted.\nMe too, Some hoe though they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.\nI can see that, they are a bit more mainstream than the other two and the network also offers lots of diverse programming.\nYup. You know Fox tried to sue the simpsons for parodying it's famous anti-democratic party agenda.\nYeah, that is kind of funny. Too bad they didnt take the hint. LOL", "candidates": ["Speaking of hints, I wonder if real criticism ever gets through to networks, or if they just brush it off and carry on with their agendas.", "LOL indeed. It's a strange world where cartoons call out news channels. Reality can be stranger than fiction sometimes, right?", "Yeah, humor can be a powerful way to show the absurd. But sometimes I worry we've gotten to where satire is the news for some people.", "Totally. It's ironic, though, a network like Fox going after satire when they defend free speech so vigorously. Shows you how touchy they can be."]}
{"context": "Hello how are you today?\nAwesome. My chakras are all aligned\nDo you work out a lot? I do\nI work in my garden growing plants all day. What do you look like?\nI am a pretty big guy, I play a lot of football", "candidates": ["Gardening is my exercise! It's peaceful and keeps me fit. Do you play football professionally?", "That's cool! Football must keep you in great shape. Do you have a favorite team or player?", "Interesting! I find gardening to be a workout too. Are you into any other sports?", "Nice, sounds like you're really active. Gardening is my way of staying healthy. How often do you play football?"]}
{"context": "Just had to stop my brother from beating me.\nWhy was he beating you?", "candidates": ["He thought I took his phone, but it was just under his bed. Misunderstanding, but he overreacted big time.", "We were arguing about politics, things got heated, and he lost his temper. Thankfully, it didn't escalate further.", "He's dealing with a lot of stress and lashed out over a small disagreement. We're usually not like this.", "Just sibling rivalry, you know? I broke his gaming headset by accident, and he flipped out before I could explain."]}

It even had a miniature statue of liberty\nWow no way you're so lucky, which places did you see? I'm sure it was so crowded considering it's the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\nI went to the \"geek\" district which I forget the name. And I went down to the waterfront\nI think you're talking about Akihabara, which is one of Tokyos 23 special wards if I'm not mistaken (I might be though).\nOh yes that is the place! Luckily when I had been there they had had the Olympics so there were English signs in the subway to make it easier\nOh that's fortunate, I've heard it's quite easy to get around in Japan because of all the English signs. I think the wards are called cities in English, which is weird.", "candidates": ["Indeed, but they're more like city districts. The transportation system is fantastic; I also saw Shibuya Crossing and the Imperial Palace\u2014so much history and neon lights everywhere!", "Yes, the wards are unique. Besides Akihabara, I visited the serene Meiji Shrine, which offered a peaceful contrast to the city buzz. Tokyo's diversity is fascinating!", "They might be called cities, but each ward has its own vibe. I even checked out Tsukiji Fish Market for some fresh sushi. That place is an experience in itself!", "You're right, they're called cities sometimes, which is a bit confusing. Besides the wards, I loved exploring the traditional side in Asakusa and the beautiful Senso-ji Temple. Truly a city of contrasts!"]}
{"context": "Surfing\nIs it hard to learn?\nWell it is just basically riding on the forward or deep face of a large wave, which usually moves a surfer towards the shore most of the time.\nI'm kinda new to the surfing scene. What would you recommend?\nWell, suitable waves are usually found in oceans, but you can also try in lakes and rivers for practice. I love surfing, and I bet you would too!\nI'm a skater, but I'm not too sure how well that would transfer to surfing. I'd really like to try it though.", "candidates": ["Skating skills can definitely help with balance on a surfboard. Try starting with some surf lessons to get the basics down!", "As a skater, you'll have a head start with balance and coordination. Just remember, the water's less forgiving than concrete, so take it slow.", "Your skateboarding experience will be beneficial! But the dynamics of water are different, so consider a beginner's surf camp to learn the ropes.", "Skateboarding provides good balance training, which is key in surfing. Find a local surf school and they'll teach you the rest \u2013 you'll do great!"]}
{"context": "Did you know there is a problem with domestic violence in LGBTQ families?\nI had no idea, but then again, I expect the DV occurs in any family, regardless of orientation.\nYeah. As with other families, there's the DV problem exacerbated by a silence that keeps it from being addressed.\nI think people are worried that the world will condemn them, maybe blame the DV on the \"gay\" aspects of the couple. But that is irrelevant. They are just people.\nAgree. No matter what the lifestyle, it takes work to maintain happy relationships.", "candidates": ["Absolutely. Understanding and addressing the underlying issues of DV without stigma is the key to helping all victims.", "It's crucial to provide supportive resources that respect the unique challenges LGBTQ individuals may face.", "Perhaps increasing visibility and open dialogue could help break the cycle of violence and silence in these situations.", "Do you think more tailored support systems for the LGBTQ community would help in dealing with domestic violence?"]}

I wanted one so bad.\nYou can name her taylor after my favorite singer! Lol swift\nThat is the name of the principal of the school I just interviewed at!", "candidates": ["Haha, what a coincidence! Maybe that's a sign of good luck for your job prospects AND your future daughter's name.", "Oh, is that a sign or what? Maybe it means both your interview and your daughter's name are meant to be!", "That\u2019s pretty funny! Seems like the universe is dropping hints.

Anyone you can stay with until it's fixed?", "I hope they get it sorted quickly on Friday. Have you thought about getting an emergency backup heater?"]}

I've heard that Canadian radios have special laws.\nYea, they have to play 40% of music made by canadian artists, I think I'll just play pandora if I'm ever in Canada", "candidates": ["Oh, Pandora's great, but I think you might find some amazing Canadian artists you'd never discover otherwise, too!", "Yeah, cultural content rules can be quite interesting. But speaking of Jupiter, you might need more sophisticated equipment than a foxhole radio to catch those storms.", "That's true, online streaming has changed how we access music. Still, it'd be a cool project to hear Jupiter's storms firsthand, wouldn't it?", "Pandora is convenient, but keep an open mind about local Canadian music.

Always ends up raining on the weekend we make plans to go!", "candidates": ["It's like the weather knows when to interrupt a good fishing trip! Maybe it's time to start planning for backup dates just in case?", "That's unfortunate! Have you considered trying a weather app or website to plan better around the rain?", "That can be frustrating. Ever thought of just embracing the rain and going anyway? A wet fishing adventure could be memorable!", "Rain on a fishing weekend sounds like a running joke!

Even just a few miles away is safer.\nDefinitely. How far inland would you say is safe while still being close to the beach?\nPersonally, I'd think 5 miles, maybe a little less would be fine.

Your own creations might become heirlooms someday, just like your grandmother's work.", "I guess if pilgrims had vibrant clothes, it's all about creativity, not just utility, even back then.

Still, it's a fun fact to contemplate, isn't it?", "You're right, actually. The White House's size is deceptive. There's a lot of space not immediately visible. It's a historical labyrinth!", "I can see what you mean about the underground levels. It's tough to gauge the true size without including all the facilities."]}

I swim mostly for exercise\u2014it's a great workout, isn't it?", "Concrete sounds solid! Our pool has a vinyl liner; it was more budget-friendly.

I'm guessing it was an old film and even still today that would be funny! Hey,did you know that ancient greece did political satire and it influenced their voters?

I guess I am just not as cool as him.", "candidates": ["Coolness isn't just about originality, it's about expressing yourself. If a purple mohawk excites you, why not put your own twist on it?", "Don't sell yourself short. We all have unique qualities that make us cool. Maybe you have another way to express your own style?", "Hey, trends start somewhere, right?

About Brady's injury list saga, some say it\u2019s a tactical move. Keeps teams on their toes, you know?", "Gisele, his wife, works as a top-level model and businesswoman. That's why she earns so much. As for Brady, maybe those injury reports are to throw off the competition.", "He's married to Gisele B\u00fcndchen, a famous model.

{"context": "Summer break seems so much shorter than I was when I was a kid. I felt it used to last forever.\nI agree! We would go for road trips. We took the car for transportation. We had a four wheeled car that sat four people.\nYeah, summers aren't actually shorter. They're about the amount of time as they used to be. Sigh, still wish I could go back to my childhood summers without a worry in the world except for boredom!", "candidates": ["Totally agree! The carefree joy of those days is unmatched. Wish we could take a summer off as adults, just to relive that freedom!", "Oh to be young and bored again! Nowadays, boredom feels like a luxury, doesn\u2019t it?", "Maybe it's adult responsibilities making summer fly by. Kids have the magic of living in the moment.", "Do you think it's nostalgia that makes those summers seem better, or were they really that much more special?"]}
{"context": "Hi! How are you doing today?\nI am good, and how are you?\nI am doing well, thank you! What kind of hobbies do you have?\nI enjoy drawing and I like to decorate the apartment that I live in.\nDecorating sounds like a lot of fun. Do you enjoy fine dining?\nI have not done that, because I am young and my mom is a busy teacher.\nMaybe I can take you sometime if you like guys with big beards\nSure, that would be nice. I have 3 siblings, how about you?", "candidates": ["I'm an only child, actually. It must be lively at your place with three siblings! When's good for a fine dining adventure?", "Just one kid in my family \u2014 me. Must be a full house with your siblings! Do they share your interest in art?", "No siblings on my end, so I've always admired large families. Are you the oldest? And regarding fine dining, do you have any cuisine preferences?", "I'm on my own; no siblings for me. It's fascinating to hear you have three! What's it like? And for dining out, any favorite food or are you open to surprises?"]}
{"context": "I felt all alone the other day\nI'm sorry to hear that. What did you do about it?\nI went to walmart to walk around and spend some money", "candidates": ["Did walking around Walmart help you feel better? Sometimes a change of scenery and a little retail therapy does the trick.", "Going out can be a good distraction. Did you find anything interesting while you were there, or was it just to pass the time?", "It's tough feeling that way. Do you often find that shopping helps when you're feeling alone, or was this a one-time thing?", "I hope the outing helped a bit. If you ever feel lonely again, don't hesitate to reach out. Maybe we can go for a walk or grab a coffee together."]}
{"context": "I drive a ford mustang and I love it! Do you like mustangs?\nI do. I also enjoy variants of the Ford Mustang because they cater to more specific portions of the marketplace that are outside of the mainstream.\nWhat other types of cars do you like?\nI like the Shelby Mustang, which is a variant that I referred to earlier. It was built by Shelby American from 1965 to 1968 and by For from 1969 to 1970.\nNeat! I don't know a lot of history of the brand.\nOh okay. Have you ever head of the Shelby Cobra? It's a sports car with a Ford v8 engine.\nI had heard of it but didn't know that much about it. Sounds fast!\nIt is. A v8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft.\nI think I only have 6 cylinders in mine,", "candidates": ["That's still great! A V6 engine offers a nice balance of power and efficiency, and in a Mustang, it yields solid performance.", "Even with six cylinders, you're driving a car with a fantastic heritage. Have you considered any performance upgrades?", "The V6 Mustangs are more fuel-efficient, and they're still plenty powerful for most driving situations.", "Nice! The V6 is a good choice, especially for daily driving. Plus, it's lighter, which can make for a different kind of fun behind the wheel."]}

I am a 32 year old woman.\nWell it would suggest that you are young in heart and mind! I am a 34 year old dad. Do you have children?\nNot right now, and maybe it's a little too late for me haha. But I've always been thinking of adopting, how do you find being a parent?\nHmm to be honest, its amazing to see a little me running about. My parents are really helpful. Why do you think its too late?\nMy parents had me when they were 20, so I feel like a grandma in comparison lol. That seems nice, I'd be worried about losing my free time though.\nI believe its a choice you end up making, for example I used to spend time in male beauty pageants, which stoped when we had Owen", "candidates": ["Wow, male beauty pageants? That's quite a change! But I guess parenting is also rewarding. It's about finding new hobbies that include your kids, right?", "Male beauty pageants sound fascinating! I imagine parenting shifts your priorities. Still, it's about balancing family and personal time somehow.", "You were in beauty pageants? That's so interesting! Giving that up must've been tough. But I guess the joy of kids outweighs it.", "From the pageant stage to the playground, huh? Must've been quite the transition.

Have you watched that series yet?\nYes I did. They did a great job showing the 80s:) music, clothing, etc.\nI am looking forward to it. Netflix has really come a long way in just a few years.\nAbsolutely, from like 2 movies in 2016 they went to dozens in 2018. They're doing a great job!\nI agree. They haven't completely eclipsed HBO, but they definitely put themselves in front of nominations.\n...but didn't GoT got the most awards? I don't remember...\nI know it is the banner program for HBO. I bet GoT is expensive to make, but it is still doing really well.", "candidates": ["Yes, GoT was definitely a big hitter at awards shows. I think the investment HBO made into it really paid off with its global fanbase and critical acclaim.", "Game of Thrones had a huge budget, and it showed in the quality. It won lots of Emmys, if I'm not mistaken. The dragons alone must've cost a fortune!", "Indeed, GoT did rack up a ton of awards. The epic scale and production value set a high bar for other series, for sure.", "GoT definitely won a record number of awards, especially for a fantasy series. It's hard to compete with such a cultural phenomenon when it comes to accolades."]}

Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster.", "candidates": ["Self-checkout would definitely help. Though I sometimes worry it might mean fewer jobs for people.", "Self-checkouts are great, but I've seen those get backed up, too, when there's a glitch or someone needs help.", "That's true, but I'm not a fan of self-checkout. It feels like we're doing the job for them without any discount.", "Yeah, self-checkouts can be faster. But what about the elderly or those not tech-savvy? They still need manned checkouts."]}
{"context": "Parenting is important for the physical, social, emotional and intellectual growth of a child. Do you have children?\nNo I do not, but I know how hard parenting could be\nIt's hard and the skills vary but a good parent masters the necessary skills. My daughters are my greatest treasures.\nThat is good. When you love your kids, caring for them will come easy\nYes! When you love your child, everything comes naturally. Parenting refers to all the intricacies of raising kids aside from the fact you are biologically related.\nYou will be more attached to something that is regarded as your blood\nIn general, the most common caretaker of a child is the parent but others can also raise a child. Aunts, Grandparents, siblings or guardians can also become great parents.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, family isn't always about blood. The love and care from any guardian play a crucial role in a child's upbringing.", "That's true. It really does take a village to raise a child, doesn't it? Everyone's role is significant.", "I agree, sometimes non-parental figures step in and provide incredible support and guidance to children.", "Yeah, the bond is special in all forms of parenting. Nurturing comes in many relationships, not just from biological parents."]}

That'd be one luxurious way for the kitties to live. Tempting...", "A yacht shelter, now that's innovative! I wonder if cats get seasick though.", "Oh, that's genius!

Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks. Lol\nIn 1895 J.P morgan bailed out the government. The government had to bail out J.P Morgan recently\nIsn't that ironic? 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government. That's where they hide the aliens. LOL", "candidates": ["Totally ironic! Speaking of land, did you know the U.S. government once bought Alaska from Russia for just 2 cents an acre? Quite the investment!", "Haha, aliens, right? By the way, have you heard about the government project, HAARP? Conspiracy theorists believe it's for weather control.", "Aliens aside, the government also has the secret Cheyenne Mountain complex.

That car is now in it's third generation.", "candidates": ["That's cool! Are there any specific models you'd recommend for someone who values fuel efficiency and safety?", "The Jazz sounds compact.

Lady Gaga surely knows how to keep us on our toes, both artistically and in the real world!", "That's quite resourceful of the LAPD. Leveraging her massive following is a smart move - a modern twist on community service announcements, courtesy of Lady Gaga's star power.", "Gaga's truly a modern-day Renaissance woman, isn't she? From pop culture to public service, she definitely plays a unique role in today's society.", "Using Twitter to spread the word on roadwork\u2014that's clever!

Like her favorite treat or a little note?", "Life happens! Have you two planned a backup date yet?", "That's rough. Is everything okay on your end? Cancelling often can be tough.", "Oh, that's tricky. What keeps causing the reschedules? Maybe there's a way to prevent a fourth time."]}
{"context": "Do you have red hair? My girlfriend has red hair.\nActually, I do have red hair.

I can't believe Google has been around since 1998.", "candidates": ["Yeah, respect and military decorum are big deals, so that could be the reason. And it's funny to think Google hasn't even been around for half of McDonald's history!", "True, it might be about maintaining a professional image while in uniform. It's wild to consider how much Google has become part of our daily lives in such a short time.", "Perhaps it was to show a separation between military and civilian life.

Modern marketing requires a balance of creativity and social responsibility.", "It's interesting to see how advertising has shifted, especially with social media's influence now.

Aren't you concerned about sharing your space with someone you just met?", "I admire your kindness, but I'm curious, how did you meet and decide to trust this person?", "That's unexpectedly kind of you. Do you make it a habit to help out strangers like this often, or was there something particular about this person?"]}

I do get sick a lot.\nThe immune system is a host defense system, that protects use against disease.\nIs there anything I can do to boost my immune system?\nI am not sure but for an immune system to function properly it must detect a wide variety of pathogens.\nI have taken a lot of antibiotics, so that may have messed my immune system up.\nHopefully the antibiotics kill the growth of bacteria like they are intended to.", "candidates": ["True, though I've heard antibiotics can't distinguish good from bad bacteria, which might be problematic.", "Maybe I should consider probiotics or a healthier diet to balance the effects of antibiotics on my gut flora.", "Are there alternative treatments to antibiotics that might be easier on the immune system?", "That makes sense, but I worry about antibiotic resistance and if it might impact future treatments."]}

{"context": "Did you know that Wikileaks published the Government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I'm guessing that plan didn't pan out so well.\nI was thinking the same thing! It definitely did not work out. I think it is cool that the Norwegian govt. Donated $1billion to help save the amazon rainforest.\nThat was an awful nice gesture from Norway. I wish our government could do something like that. Our government would probably try to buy the Eiffel tower twice from a man in France, who was impersonating a government official.\nProbably. Our government is supposed to be balanced but I find when it is balanced all we have is gridlock. It is frustrating.\nYes it is. It's disturbing that in 2006 they passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Conventions.\nDefinitely. I believe that this immigration is tough but it has become an all out war between republicans and democrats.\nYes it has. I wonder how the government would be if it was still run like it was before 1805? Back then the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the Vice President. I think it would cause them to have to work together.\nThat would be a novel concept! Can you even imagine Trump and Obama working together.\nI can't, or even him and Hillary. Even though the families used to be close.\nIt would be a disaster! The role of the president is so important. Especially ours. It is not as much ceremonial like it is in parliamentary republics.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the president has immense power in our system. But, don't you think that gridlock sometimes serves as a check on that power?", "True, it's far from ceremonial. But I often wonder if a touch of bipartisanship from those days could temper the current political climate.", "The dynamics would be fascinating! But perhaps it speaks to the need for reform in how we manage executive-legislative relations today.", "Disaster or not, it would definitely change the political game.

What did they do?\nThey keep defending those sanctuary cities that are full of criminal imigrants", "candidates": ["Do you think there's a distinction between criminals and those looking for safety and a better life?", "I understand your frustration, but not all immigrants in sanctuary cities are criminals. The situation is complex.", "Have you considered that sanctuary policies might be aimed at protecting vulnerable people rather than harboring criminals?", "That's a strong viewpoint. Have you looked into the statistics of crime in those cities compared to others?"]}

It is amazing how long they have been together.\nOh you have great taste, those albums are awesome too. I especially like how Kill'Em All fused new wave British metal riffs with punk tempos.", "candidates": ["Definitely, that fusion really set the stage for thrash metal. Ever been to a Metallica gig? Their live performances take those albums to another level!", "Absolutely, \"Kill'Em All\" was revolutionary. I'm also into Anthrax and Megadeth. Do you like other Big Four bands?", "That punk influence made their sound so raw and energetic.

The Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It's the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nI dont know it well, but my favorite character is the racoon, or Groot.\nYes, I know Groot. Did you know that Avengers: Infinity War is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital iMax cameras? Is that cool or what?\nThat is really cool. Did you hear about Robert Downey Jr. Hiding food on set?", "candidates": ["Yes, I did! Downey's snacking is legendary. He'd hide food everywhere and munch during scenes, which became an ongoing gag.", "Actually, his hidden snacks were improvised! It's great how some spontaneous moments make it into the final film.", "No way, that's hilarious! It\u2019s so fitting for his character, Tony Stark, to be snacking nonchalantly while saving the world.", "I hadn't heard that, but it's such a Robert Downey Jr. thing to do!

Would you consider setting some conditions on your financial support until her attendance improves?", "That sounds challenging. Maybe there\u2019s an underlying issue. Do you think she might benefit from a counselor or advisor\u2019s help?", "That must be disheartening. Do you think not attending is a sign she might not be interested in her major anymore?"]}

Are there any specific venues you recommend that are both fun and safe?", "Oh wow, safety first for sure. Do you think most clubs are better equipped now to handle emergencies?", "You're right, I completely forgot about that tragedy.

Make sure to pack plenty of blankets if you're planning to stay overnight.", "Indeed, the desert can surprise you with its nighttime cold.

Probably a show of friendship and solitude.\nYeah I agree, I wonder if the twin buildings have solar panels on the roof as well.\nI would hope so, but that has been a controversy for the White House here though.\nThey have removed them, placed them back again, removed them once more and then finally Bush placed them back, I think that's how it goes.\nI guess they are more symbolic than practical. Kind of like the current occupant of the WH.\nYou mean president Trump\nYes, I figure that he is an interesting case of what can happen to the Presidency. I imagined that he would be one of the richest POTUS. Not the case.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, Trump's wealth is significant, but not the highest among presidents. It's sometimes surprising to compare reality with our assumptions about leaders' wealth.", "Wealth aside, every president leaves their own unique mark on the office, for better or worse.", "True, some sources suggest presidents like Washington or Kennedy might have been wealthier. Trump's financials have certainly been a topic of much debate.", "Yeah, his wealth is considerable but it's his distinctive leadership style that often overshadows discussions about his financial status."]}

Does it have any other uses besides clothing?", "candidates": ["Absolutely, alpaca fiber is also used in home textiles like blankets and throws due to its warmth and softness.", "In addition to textiles, alpaca manure is a fantastic garden fertilizer, promoting plant growth without the harsh chemicals.", "Besides clothing, alpaca fiber can be found in various crafts and even as luxurious stuffing in bedding and upholstery.", "You'd be surprised, but alpaca wool is also used in making some high-end outdoor gear, due to its thermal properties and moisture resistance."]}

What do you like to cook?\nSure but not all comfort food needs to be processed, take a fesh pasta for example.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, fresh pasta is a treat! Do you have a favorite recipe or pasta shape that you prefer making?", "Fresh pasta does sound inviting. Ever experiment with adding herbs or veggies into the dough for extra flavor?", "That's true, homemade pasta is a great example.

Herbs would be really cool.\nI love gardening, it's one of my favorite things to do.

I love that it was published in 1949, but is still relevant now.\nAbsolutely! Its almost eerie how relevant it is still. Reminds me of Brave New World by Aldous Huxley\nI do believe it is very relevant in this political climate. Especially in the subjects of individualism and independent thinking\nI agree. How specifically do you see the book address the subjects of individualism and independent thinking?", "candidates": ["Orwell shows a society where individualism is punished to maintain control, which is chillingly similar to how some modern governments censor free expression.", "The book depicts the struggle of Winston Smith's personal rebellion, demonstrating the importance of independent thought against oppressive regimes.", "Through Newspeak language and thoughtcrime, Orwell explores how restricting language and ideas can crush individualism and independent thinking.", "Totalitarian control in '1984' reflects current surveillance states and the manipulation of information, directly attacking an individual's ability to think and act freely."]}

Urban agriculture can also involve aquaculture, beekeeping, and horticulture.\nI've never heard of aquaculture. What is that?", "candidates": ["Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic plants. It's like agriculture, but in water!", "Oh, aquaculture is interesting \u2013 it's basically underwater farming.

It sound slike the plane has had issues before though.\nYa I wouldnt take a $100 million plane lightly, but what can they do to him its not like he has to pay them back lol.

I think I might inquiry about the navy if that happened to me. And this isn't the first time a pilot has been forced to eject from an F-35.", "candidates": ["True, there could be underlying issues with the plane. The Navy's got a rigorous training for ejection scenarios, I'd bet they'd rather have a live pilot and a lost jet than the other way around.", "That's quite a bit of responsibility on the pilot's shoulders. The safety protocols must be crystal clear to prevent hesitation in life-threatening situations. Clearly, the pilot's life is the top priority.", "Absolutely, the cost of the plane is huge, but you can't put a price on a human life. Plus, the military surely factors potential losses into their operations. Still, it's gotta weigh on you after the fact.", "Investigating is key, especially to prevent future incidents. It's not just about the money or the equipment, but improving safety measures. And you're right, ejections don't happen often, which shows the F-35\u2019s resilience despite this crash."]}

{"context": "I have a pet iguana from Mexico! Not as cuddly as a dog, but I love him anyway. His name is Ignacio, Iggy for short.\nAre Iguanas good pets?

He plays for the Golden State Warriors, and he's their star and MVP, but shockingly enough he only makes the 5th highest salary on his team.\nThat is outrageous. Surely, he deserves better. Why, he even had won a NBA Most Valuable Player Award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975! He is truly underrated.\nYeah, I agree with you! He sounds like a good man also, because he plays part in a foundation that donates mosquito nets to protect families in africa.

Truly deserved.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, his skills on the court and his heart off it are unmatched.

Different styles must affect people differently\u2014I wonder if Baroque or Romantic pieces would work just as well for that shopping center.", "Right, the term 'classical music' really does cover a lot of ground. It's funny to think that Mozart can be both a sophisticated artistic choice and a tool for crowd control, isn't it?", "Oh, so it's not all just one big category! Maybe the shopping center should mix it up with different eras. Could keep the teens guessing\u2014today Bach, tomorrow Wagner!", "It's interesting how that era of music, in particular, is seen as 'classical'.

Do you know how the drive thru came about?\nYes that was out in place by McDOnal's in 1975, something about the soldiers right\nYes they were not allowed to get out of the cars in fatigues\nWell they have made an excellent business from them, and the others too\nTrue. Do you know why the trunk of the car is called as such?\nI think it is because old cars used to have wooden trunks", "candidates": ["Absolutely correct! Historically, cars had actual luggage trunks strapped to the back. Now it's all integrated into the vehicle's design.", "Right, the name's a holdover from when people literally attached a trunk to the car's rear.", "Yeah, that's part of it. Also, 'trunk' in America is like the 'boot' in British English, both terms stuck from those early designs.", "Interesting history, isn't it? The term evolved as cars did, but we still use the old-fashioned word 'trunk' today."]}

But remember, correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation in these events.", "Your mom sounds insightful, but it's important to look at data before forming a conclusion about airplane safety trends.", "That's an interesting observation. However, strict regulations and technological advancements usually make flying safer over time.", "Perhaps it's just more noticeable when an accident follows improvements.

I suppose they want to preserve their'Canadian-ness '. I had heard that Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up by AM radios. I wonder if Canadian radio regulations account for that?\nHaha maybe Jupiter has aliens that require 40% of Jupiter radio to be of Jupiter origin, I wonder what they sound like", "candidates": ["Jupiter's sounds would be otherworldly!

Was the money effective in its original mission? Yes, I think I would be angered but would have to keep my cool. Spain is the only guest that has been at ever G20 summit, I guess they didn't offend anyone like Putin did to the Canadian Prime Minister.\nNot sure on how the money was delegated.

As for the tiger conservation effort, it would be interesting to see a study on the population trends since the summit.", "Woodrow Wilson, huh? A president with a PhD is pretty noteworthy. It makes me curious about the educational backgrounds of other world leaders.", "Wow, a Ph.D. president is quite a trivia tidbit. On a separate note, I'd love to learn more about these international summits and their outcomes.", "Interesting about Wilson! Educational backgrounds can certainly shape leadership.

{"context": "Hi, do you watch nfl?\nYes, I like to watch football, did you watched the superbowl?\nI did. Did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay?\nI heard that, but that is hard to believe, because 11 minutes is too short of time to be divide into four quarters.\nYeah but there is a lot of waiting around and they do not account for that", "candidates": ["That's true. Most of the broadcast is replays, commercials, and discussions. It's more about the whole event than just the live action.", "I wonder if that includes the time for plays between the whistles, or just the clock running.", "It's crazy when you think about it. Puts into perspective the importance of strategy in those 11 minutes.", "Really? I always thought the tension and tactics during the pauses were part of the game's charm, even if they're not active gameplay."]}

Did it run off after that?", "Raccoons are surprisingly clever creatures. Maybe it's a regular visitor to those trash cans. Ever seen it around before?", "Yikes! Raccoons can carry diseases.

Maybe as we move along we will get that enzyme that we are missing to make vitamin C\nWho knows. There's been a lot of evolution over time. Development of an enzyme creation may be as likely as the development of manual dexterity.\nYeah you never know. Do you know why we are so good at long distance running\nSpeaking from personal experience, we aren't:) But, on a species level, I would assume it is because of the shape of the human body. Whatever it is, it definitely helped in sustaining mankind early in development by allowing further migrations.\nYeah that is true I do not think we are as good as when we used to hunt, that is how that came about", "candidates": ["Absolutely, persistence hunting was our ancestors' forte. We evolved to outlast our prey with endurance, not speed.

Slow and steady often won the race back then, helping humans secure food and thrive across various terrains.", "We may not run down antelope now, but marathons show that we've kept that long-distance ability. It's a legacy of our hunter-gatherer past, necessary for both hunting and scavenging over vast distances.", "True, our sedentary lifestyle has dulled our natural running prowess.

In some European countries, for example, there are stricter regulations and government support for animal shelters, while in others, NGOs play a larger role.", "Each country's approach is different. For instance, some have stronger centralized regulations and funding for animal welfare, which can lead to better shelter conditions.", "In some countries, animal shelters receive government support and oversight, but practices are diverse. It can depend on local laws, cultural attitudes towards animals, and economic factors."]}

I like to crochet.\nI don't think I have the patience for crochet. I do like other forms of art though, such as painting. What kind of things do you like to crochet?\nMy favorite things to crochet are blankets. What kinds of things to you find when you geocache?\nIt's always a mystery. People will but random things for others to find, but its not about what you find it's about the hunt to find it.", "candidates": ["The thrill of the hunt sounds exhilarating! Do you have a favorite geocaching memory?", "I love the mystery aspect of geocaching! Maybe I could join you sometime; it sounds like a real adventure.", "That's so cool! Geocaching seems like a great way to explore new places. Have you ever traveled specifically for it?", "It must be exciting not knowing what you'll find! Have you ever left something special for others to find in a geocache?"]}

We are Packers fan at my house, how about you?\nMy husband is a huge fan, so I know a bit about the game. Personally I don't understand all the hype for an average of only 11 minutes of live gameplay.", "candidates": ["I get that, but those intense 11 minutes are packed with strategy, skill, and excitement! It\u2019s like a high-stakes chess match with athletic prowess.", "That's a fair point! The game does involve a lot of stoppages, but for many of us fans, the tactical depth and the suspense in between make it worth it.", "Only 11 minutes, sure, but it's the tension, the buildup, and the community around the game that really draw people in. Plus, there's nothing like a game day atmosphere!", "Interesting perspective! I think the appeal is also in the rituals and traditions of watching the game, not just the playtime. It's a whole experience!"]}

It's just sitting in my wallet. Maybe I'll donate it, sort of pay it forward, you know?", "Well, I got myself lunch, but it didn't taste right. I should've at least asked around if someone lost money.", "I thought about buying something but felt too guilty. I think I'll drop it off at a charity bin as a compromise."]}

Do you play in a band?\nI do from time to time. I just love that drum kits can consist of acoustic instruments and electronic drums.\nDrum kits are definitely very cool, I've heard of something called a drum trigger too but I'm not too sure what it is exactly.\nIt's a part of the electronic drum kit. It helps produce synthesized sound along with some electronic sensors.\nSounds cool. What kind of music do you like? I really like Metallica just to name one band.\nMetallica is great. I agree with you. They are originally from Los Angeles.", "candidates": ["No kidding! Being from LA must've been inspiring for them.

I know Bill Clinton's approval rating went up after the affair he had with Monica.\nVery interesting indeed! I was reading about the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France, very cool. I think we have had some interesting presidents!\nIndeed we have had interesting presidents and wealthy ones as well. The top three wealthiest were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. I wonder out of the three who was the richest.\nWow, that is interesting. I bet they were all pretty wealthy. There is so much chatter about e mails within the white house and government and I find it funny Bill Clinton only sent 2 emails his entire time in office! Lol\nLol and to think his wife got into trouble for over sharing her emails. Goofy things happen in politics; for example, the first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana.", "candidates": ["Haha, President Banana, what a name! Politics sure have their quirks. Anyhow, about those buildings in Ireland and France, I find it fascinating how architecture can mirror political power.", "Oh, I know! Hillary's email saga was quite the scandal. On a different note, regarding presidential wealth, I've always wondered how much of it influenced their policies.", "President Banana, that's hilarious! Though, back to the wealth topic, I've read that adjusting for inflation, Washington was the richest. Historical wealth can be tricky to measure, though.", "True, from President Banana to the Clintons' email dramas, every term brings its own surprises. Speaking of wealth, I suspect land holdings would've made Washington the richest, but it's complex comparing across centuries!"]}

They are very useful beasts. I have a horse. She is about six years old now. She is part of the family.\nYeah they are very useful, I am more of a dog person myself but I love all animals. I just seen they sleep while standing and lying, I thought once one was lying it was bad and they wouldnt get back up\nYeah. It is something to see. They do lay down sometimes, though. It is not always bad.\nOh ok, thats pretty neat, I never knew that. So I know anything equine related uses different terms, what kind of horse do you have?\nI have a Palamino. She is a bit spotty. Brown and white.\nOh ok neat. Is she a race horse or show horse?", "candidates": ["She's actually not a racehorse or a show horse; she's more of a trail horse.

I'm still unsure how botox does that. I understand why you do it but still my point.\nYes, that's a valid perspective. I don't really need an escape because I have never had to work a day in my life.\nThat must be nice. I've been working since I was 16.\nIf I had to, I would! Working since age 16 sounds like a LOT. Maybe this is why my sister-in-law doesn't like me, because I don't work?\nI wouldn't if I didn't have to.

It's no coincidence that everything was brought to light the same night Katy Perry's album dropped and when Taylor Swift released all her music for streaming. Headlines always seem to sell.\nI agree, it does seem suspicious, I heard that Swift posted a post of an olive branch hours before a concert of the Reputation Tour\nYeah and she posted the note that Perry had written, and made it seem like Perry was the one who started everything.\nYeah it seems rehearsed but anyway do you like any of them as artists? I think Swift has good songs.", "candidates": ["Definitely, Swift has catchy tunes. I'm a fan of Perry's older work, but Swift's songwriting resonates more with me personally.", "To be honest, not really my taste. I appreciate their knack for marketing, though. I tend to lean towards more indie artists.", "I actually like both! Katy Perry's anthems are great for a party, and Swift's lyrics have more depth for when I'm feeling introspective.", "I'm kind of neutral on their music, but I respect their talent and hard work. It's impressive how they manage their careers and image."]}

I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens.\nI used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.\nIt is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens.", "candidates": ["Haha, true! But hey, those Hollywood types take their security seriously, so an alien attack plan might not be that far-fetched for them.", "Yeah, Scientology does have some unique beliefs. Maybe Tom's bunker is his way of preparing for every possibility.", "Honestly, sci-fi often blurs with reality for some folks.

Usually, I advocate honesty, but don't know enough about your situation to advise.\nWell, I think he is cheating on me so I took his spare I-phone that I suspect he is using to do it with! It is locked and I can't get in the phone to find the evidence.\nOh boy. I honestly don't know what to say. Maybe ask him outright if he's cheating. If he is, do you really want to stay with him?

I don't wanna have to live in an orphanage or with my relatives.", "candidates": ["It's a tough process, involving courts, foster systems, or maybe adoption. Kids need a lot of support to get through that.", "Luckily, there are usually social services in place to help orphans find stable homes, but it can be a long, hard road.", "The thought of living in an orphanage is daunting, but sometimes they can be supportive communities.

They have conical shaped teeth that help them to capture fast moving prey.", "candidates": ["That's fascinating! Do they hunt individually or work together in groups?", "Interesting about their teeth! I heard some species use tools or strategies to catch fish, is that true?", "Fish make sense.

While both pasta and meatballs have Italian roots, the specific dish of spaghetti and meatballs as a common pairing is more of an American innovation.", "Oops, I misspoke. The meatballs part isn't traditionally served with pasta in Italy. It's something Italian immigrants popularized in America as a single dish."]}

What about a good old fashioned rod and reel? What kind of bait is best?\nWell, you could try fishing farmed fish first if you want - it may be easier - and you could use worms.", "candidates": ["Farm fishing sounds like a gentler start. If I go with worms and a rod, what's a good location for a beginner like me?", "Interesting! Are there specific kinds of worms or any worm does the trick for bait?", "That's a good idea.

I'm a bit nervous about contacts, but it sounds like a good idea. Also, do you offer yoga classes for absolute beginners?", "Contacts could be an option, I suppose!

I have such reverance for the office that his presidency will be seen as a stain on the history of the USA. I do not mind talks of walls or economics but the way he has done it has divided this country and caused such unnecessary anger.", "candidates": ["Exactly, the divisiveness is alarming. I hope we learn and choose leaders who unite rather than divide in the future.", "I share your concern. It's pivotal we remember respect and dignity while discussing politics, even when we disagree.", "Your reverence is commendable. Perhaps future administrations will restore dignity and bipartisanship.", "It's a tough time for unity. I'm focusing on community-level actions to counteract that divisiveness.

Perhaps the terrain doesn't lend itself to rail.\nI wonder how fast the bullet train goes. I wonder if the cold would stop the trains from working too often.\nThe cold weather can be a problem. Usually snow is the issue. The first king to travel around the world was from Hawaii.\nI wonder how much of Amazon deliveries go by train.

The flavor isn't to my liking much. Do you go to the park a lot?\nSometimes. It depends on what mood I'm in being bipolar in all. Luckily the meds are helping with that.\nBipolar is really a tough disorder to deal with. I think being outdoors would help a lot. And taking time for just yourself.\nYeah, it does.

I also like the Pistons because I live in Michigan\nThe Warriors have had a ton of talent and have been to the Finals in the past three seasons.\nI guess they were founded in 1946 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Then they relocated to San Francisco in 1962\nCool, and this year they had the best net rating in the NBA.\nSomehow they earned 12 million dollars after losing game 4. This was last year. Can you explain how that's possible haha I just don't get it\nThats pretty good if you get paid that much even when you lose! Haha. I'm not sure how that works either.", "candidates": ["Yeah, that payout is wild! I think it might have to do with revenue sharing and TV deals that the NBA has, even if a team loses, they still get a slice!", "I guess that's the economics of sports - broadcast rights, merchandise, ticket sales might contribute, not just game outcomes.", "You're right, it's a mystery. I'm guessing there are performance bonuses or contractual clauses we're not aware of.", "Haha, well, I read it could be from the league's revenue pool. The NBA's business side is as intriguing as the games themselves!"]}

And to think blockbuster declined to buy it for only 50 million.\nYes, Many of people want entertainment and so many social apps are introduced make the cost low.\nYes. Although I have noticed they are raising the prices on subscription services like Netflix as the demand increases. It's probably because they're now producing content instead of just licensing it. Did you know it's available worldwide except in China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea?\nYes, It is available is some countries only now.

Of all the seemingly intelligent presidents we've had, that is very surprising. I wonder if \"President Banana\", Zimbabwe's first president, had a PhD? Ha!\nHmm I don't know. I guess US presidents don't focus on academics anymore, FDR was the last one to speak a foreign language fluently\nYou'd think all public officials would be required to speak at least one foreign language.

Do you drive a car by the way\nAs little as possible. I mostly prefer to get around on my bicycle. Cars are very convenient but they alos destroy the world with all the pollution.

I've been to South Africa and I think most people just have guns.\nHaha I know it is actually legal, but what do you think about how cars got named trunks in terms of the back of where people store stuff\nMakes sense to me. In those days when you traveled by ship you could bring a lot of stuff and the big boxes were called trunks. The brits call it the boot.

It's a racing game where you drive cars\nI don't think so, I was doing Crazy Taxi for a while since we had one at work.

Would you say the deep dish is more like a pie then, with all the fillings and cheese?", "So, is it the thickness of the crust that mainly sets Chicago pizza apart?", "Deep dish, huh?

More than that, Netflix and YouTube together make up more than half of all Internet Traffic in North America.\nThat's pretty amazing. Netflix spends more than 20 times on postage than bandwidth which is also amazing.\nThat is why they are phasing out DVDs.

What about you?\nI watch an occasional NFL game, but I don't pay attention consistently.

{"context": "Good morning! How are you today? I'm hanging out watching some Fox News.\nDoing good thanks. Do you like Bill Cosby?\nI do not. I am glad for the guilty verdict against him.\nI agree, there were just too many women who came forward for it not to be true. I have loved his comedy since I was just a kid but this changes everything.\nYes, it is disgusting. So, do you like horror films?\nYes I do. My favorite was the exorcist but at the time the cast didn't know it was a horror film.", "candidates": ["Really? I didn't know that about The Exorcist cast! It's quite an iconic film. Have any recent horror flicks caught your eye?", "That's an intriguing bit about The Exorcist; I had no idea. Are there any other classics or new horror movies you recommend?", "I always thought The Exorcist was chilling. It's surprising the cast was unaware. Do you also like horror series, or just films?", "I didn't know the cast was in the dark about The Exorcist being horror! What did you think about the special effects, given the time it was made?"]}

What toppings did you go for on this legendary pizza?", "A legend, eh? Guess I'll need to taste it to confirm that claim. When are you opening your pizzeria?", "Sounds like you've got some serious pizza-making skills. You should share your recipe!", "That's awesome! There's nothing like homemade pizza.

Blanche is the latest\nOh nice, haven't seen that but every time I see one I can't help but smile, not much into small dogs but if I was to get one it would be a frenchie", "candidates": ["Frankly, they're not just adorable; they're also quite clever and have big personalities for such small dogs.", "I totally get you. Even non-small dog lovers tend to find Frenchies irresistible, with their smooshy faces and playful nature.", "If you're ever considering it, just be aware they need lots of love and can have health issues due to their build.", "They sure are unique little charmers. Just seeing a Frenchie waddle along is enough to brighten anyone's day, don't you think?"]}

{"context": "I read that, since 1900, the taller US candidate has won the election 75% of the time. What does that say about our society and how superficial we can be?\nIt says we are more concerned about what is on the outside than the inside. I'm certain the prettier/more handsome candidate wins more than others as well. I like the lengths India goes to for it's voters, setting up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter.\nI know, right? It's almost as if India DOESN'T want people to vote. Nevada is the only state to have a \"none of these candidates\" option in the voting booth. I would have used that option in 2016, had I lived there.\nI wonder how the astronauts get to keep their ballot secret when voting from space. I always assumed they would do absentee ballots before they took off.\nYou would think so, but they could be easily tampered with, if they did. 34% of black males in Alabama permanently lost the right to vote. I wonder why?", "candidates": ["That's shocking about black males in Alabama. I think it's tied to felony disenfranchisement laws, which disproportionately affect minority communities.", "The voting restrictions on black males in Alabama seem like remnants of historical discrimination. Are they harsher on felonies?", "It's deeply concerning regarding Alabama. Laws need reform to address such racial disparities in voting rights.", "The Alabama statistic shows systemic issues.

Maybe you can tell me more about the company that is making this awesome car\nHonda is the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles and internal combustion engines. They product more than 14 million internal combustion engines a year. Incredible!\nYes it is indeed incredible. When was the company founded?\nNot sure, but I can tell you that the magnificent Honda Civic was first introduced in 1972.\nHow has the numbers in sales Honda been able to help the country's GDP?\nYou'd have to ask an economist about that one, old chap. Civics are fuel-efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly - so that's what my mind is fixated on.", "candidates": ["Fair point! The eco-friendliness is quite an attraction. Does Honda have any plans for electric vehicles?", "Indeed, the Civic's qualities are notable. Are there any new features in the latest model that set it apart?", "I appreciate the focus on practicality.

I didn't know that about the Celtics. What's another reason you like them so much?\nThey are the hometown team, been a big fan since I was 8\nNice, nostalgia factor. Wish I could make it out to see them, but with my rent being raised tickets are a no-go.\nThey will be good again\nNo doubt! I'll keep an eye out for them on TV.

Have you been able to enjoy the outdoors despite your busy schedule?", "Absolutely, spring always feels refreshing. By the way, do you still play basketball at the local court?", "I agree.

That can be dangerous, you hear stories of people falling in all the time.\nI was just a kid", "candidates": ["It's definitely a rational fear for a kid, considering how unpredictable ice can be. Did someone teach you how to check if the ice was safe?", "I'm glad you were okay. Have you become more comfortable walking on ice since then?", "Those stories certainly make it clear how important it is to be cautious. Did your parents ever give you safety tips for walking on frozen ponds?", "Being cautious is smart, especially for a child. Do you still enjoy winter activities like that, or did the fear stick with you?"]}

{"context": "McDonald's\nWhat do you mean by \"rechristen their business\"? Sort of an odd choice of words haha\nThey were not a hamburger stand at first, it was hot dogs.\nAn improvement, I think. Hot dogs are gross.\nGross. They are just awful!\nThey are! But the french fries there are so good. They're my favorite.\nNothing beat s a nice order of crispy french fries and a nice drink\nSome people like to dip their fries in a milkshake, but I never saw the appeal.\nYeah I don't understand either. The fries would warm the mlikshake and the fries would be cooled by it.\nExactly! But to each their own.", "candidates": ["Anyway, it's all about personal taste. Have you ever tried any of their seasonal menu items or stuck with the classics?", "True, everyone has their quirks! So, outside of McDonald's, where else do you go for your fast food fix?", "You ever mix it up with their dipping sauces?

{"context": "I am not sure I like restaurants that try to be something they are not. A Los Vegas place has little reason to emulate the Amalfi Coast.\nI agree. The food seems enticing though, like Florentine style steak and brazino. And ricotta cheesecake for dessert\nThe restaurant, Osteria Costa does not serve anything but dinner. I find that annoying. If I stay at this hotel, can I get lunch or do I have to venture out onto the strip?\nHaha you are right. I guess you would have to venture out or order a pizza or something.\nThe margherita pizza does sound good. I would like to try it. Not sure making a pizza requires a executive chef with a fancy name.\nTrue. The waiters seem overly enthusiastic though. I do not want my dinner to be interrupted too much\nWaiters can be annoying. Dinner and a show with Mariah Carey to sing would annoy me as well. Sure, its a 200 seat restaurant. Lets have some one famous sing to distract everyone.\nHa, but would you not want to have a selfie with giant frosted trees and Christmas ornaments the size of igloos?\nAh, the selfie. I would like a selfie with lemon ricotta cheesecake from the restaurant.\nYum. They have pleasing fish and seafood. I wonder if it's served in an aesthetic manner. I prefer to observe fish rather than eat them though. Seahorses are cool, they are the only fish to have a neck.", "candidates": ["Seahorses are fascinating, indeed. Speaking of aesthetics, do you reckon the plating of the fish dishes mirrors the artistic vibe of the place?", "I'm with you on observing sea life. Perhaps we could check out an aquarium-themed restaurant instead, one with live seahorses.", "Really? I had no idea about seahorses and necks. I always learn something new with you. But back to dinner, what else is on the menu that's eye-catching?", "True, seahorses are unique. But I doubt they'd serve them here! Still, it'd be neat if the restaurant had an aquarium with them."]}

Any characters you're hoping to see in the lineup?", "For sure, A! Have you heard any rumors about the character roster?", "Totally!

They aqre well suited to live in all kinds of areas...out on farms or in regular suburban homes.\nI have 2 small children and a kitten in the house, do you believe a golden retriever is the perfect dog for this situation?\nWell, they are very easy to train, even up to advanced obedience standards, so I think they could be trained to tolerate all kinds of people and animals.\nThat is quite comforting to hear! This will be my first time being a dog owner. Is there a lot of upkeep as far as shedding, exercise, etc?\nThey do shed, since they are a long coated breed.\nSo I will need to buy brushes and shedding supplies. Would you suggest, as a first time dog owner, a Puppy or Adult Golden Retriever?", "candidates": ["For first-time owners, a puppy may be a more malleable choice. You can shape its habits early on, but prepare for intensive training and socialization effort.", "An adult may be easier since they're often already trained and less rambunctious, helpful when you have small kids.", "Puppies require more time and patience, especially with training and socializing. If you're ready for the challenge, it can be rewarding to grow with them.", "You might consider adopting an older dog; they can be calmer and adapt quickly to your family's routine, making the transition smoother."]}

How's your day been?\nMy day was pretty good, it's been quite busy and all with fixing cars.\nAt least you've had things to do! What kind of cars did you fix?\nI was working on my dad's old Chevrolet, thing's a workhorse but its a fixer upper.\nOh cool! I bet that was really interesting.", "candidates": ["Definitely interesting! It's a '67 Camaro, so I love working on it. Classic cars have such character, don't they?", "It was! Learning a lot about car mechanics. Do you have any hobbies outside of work?", "For sure, there's always something new to learn with these old models. Keeps my problem-solving skills sharp!", "It's a challenge but rewarding. Ever thought about doing something hands-on like car restoration?"]}

Leonard's mom called the police on his son after getting into an argument.\nI think I did hear something about that incident.\nBut the police sent over a SWAT team for some reason. Nothing was stated about Leonard being armed\nWonder why SWAT was sent then? I thought only got sent out if someone dangerous had barricaded themselves in a building and wouldn't come out.\nYeah, I'm losing trust in the police at this point. Thomas's family was reward $15.1 million so at least something good came out of it.", "candidates": ["That's a huge settlement; it must've been a serious case of misconduct. Did they say what's happening with the officer now?", "$15.1 million can't replace a life, but at least it's accountability. Has this changed any policies?", "Wow, 15 million is a lot, but you can't put a price on life. Is Leonard's family pushing for reforms?", "SWAT seems extreme for an argument. Does the payout mean the police admitted a mistake, or was it a no-fault settlement?"]}

If you tell me what game genres you like, I could recommend one of the games I've worked on!", "That's awesome, I appreciate it! I'm actually working on a new title and I'll keep you updated. What type of games do you enjoy?", "Glad to hear it! I don't have any released games yet, but I'm working on one. What genres are you into?", "That would be amazing, thank you!

Maybe I'll do some mock interviews to build my confidence.", "Alright, I'll try focusing on my breathing and not the unexpected questions. Thanks for the pep talk.", "I appreciate the advice.

Do you ever encounter any wild animals?", "candidates": ["Absolutely! I've come across deer, rabbits, and even the occasional eagle. It's always thrilling to observe them in their natural habitat.", "Sometimes, yes. Mostly small animals, though there's always the chance of seeing bears or coyotes, so I stay prepared.", "I have seen wildlife, but I keep a safe distance. It's important to respect their space and not disturb them.", "Not often, surprisingly. I tend to hike on well-traveled trails, so maybe the animals keep their distance from those areas."]}
{"context": "Volunteering\nYesss, in fact tomorrow I will go again and I think tomorrow there will be new volunteers and I think I will have to train them\nThat'll be worthwhile. The word \"Volunteer\" comes from the French \"Voluntaire\" back around 1600and meant One who offers himself for military service.\nThat is really interesting. Where did you learn that?\nI don't remember. I tend to pick up useless trivia everywhere I go....What do you do for a living?\nI am a stay at home mom of two lovely boys. How about you?\nI'm a property manager. I was a stay at home mom for a long time.\nHow do you like property management?", "candidates": ["I enjoy it, provides a good balance of desk work and getting out and about. Plus, solving tenant issues is always interesting.", "It's challenging but rewarding. I get to meet different people every day and no two days are the same.", "Honestly, it has its ups and downs.

{"context": "Hi! Can you believe a Florida legislator's aide said two of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors were actors? That is sad!\nIt's despicable, but unfortunately I can believe it. Some people are so willing to believe in conspiracies that support their politics that they decide to disregard basic human decency. He claimed that there's a YouTube video that's proof!\nAgreed. I know people make mistakes and put politics and beliefs befoee country, but I'm glad the aide was fired. Perhaps it'll teach Benjamin to think next time. I love traveling to Florida often, but that makes me hesitant. Speaking of traveling, do you like to travel?\nNot so much recently, but I have been to other places, and it's always interesting to see how they go about transportation differently than in the U.S. Iceland doesn't even have public rail service!", "candidates": ["Wow, no rail service in Iceland? That's fascinating! Must be because of their terrain. Have you ever tried their geothermal pools?", "That's wild about Iceland! Do you find other forms of transport there convenient? Also, that firing felt like a small step towards accountability, didn't it?", "No trains in Iceland is surprising. Did the landscape make you reluctant to explore or was it part of the adventure? Politics can't spoil the beauty of travel, thankfully.", "Interesting about Iceland! It's crazy how different places adapt. Makes me wonder how public opinion impacts infrastructure, much like politics shapes narratives back home, huh?"]}
{"context": "Hey, how are you today?\nPretty good and how about you?\nNot doing good. I'm agoraphobic and am afraid of wide open spaces\nThen better close your mind up", "candidates": ["That's a bit insensitive. It's not something I can control easily; it's a real struggle for me every day.", "I wish it was that simple. Do you have any helpful strategies for managing anxiety?", "I don't appreciate sarcasm about my condition. It's tough enough to face the world with this fear.", "Ha, if only it worked like that. Seriously though, talking about it usually helps me a bit."]}

You are your brother must have a close relationship.\nWe do but we don\u2019t see each other often enough", "candidates": ["It's tough when life gets busy. Maybe you could plan a regular hangout to keep that connection strong?", "Are there ways to connect with technology? Video calls or online games can sometimes bridge the gap.", "Distance does make it harder. Perhaps a shared hobby or project could bring you together more often?", "I hear you.

It got a ton of backlash from the community.", "Nope, it used to be Bieber, but now the most disliked video is \"YouTube Rewind 2018.\" It didn't resonate well with viewers at all."]}

Do you watch the NFL games much?\nI do, that's what most of my Sunday's consist of. I really liked the Patriots when they had Bejarvus Green-Ellis. He never fumbled the ball.\nYeah that is quite amazing. Did you know U odf Iowa had the visitor locker room painted pink?\nI didn't know that. I wonder how many times that's backfired on them?", "candidates": ["It's actually a psychological tactic by their coach Hayden Fry to calm the opponents. Pretty unique, huh?", "The pink locker room is more about tradition and psychology than an actual curse, but it's meant to throw teams off their game.", "I'm not sure, but it\u2019s a quirky touch that's garnered a lot of attention. Do you think something like that could really affect a team's performance?", "I don't think it's backfired often. It's intended to psych out the visiting teams.

An adult on a child's bike is not something you see every day. Do you think it was a performance or just for fun?", "I love when people express themselves like that.

About Trump, well, wealth comparisons are always tricky. Are they factoring in inflation for those historic presidents?", "Interesting. I'm actually more surprised about the skirt rule! As for the presidents' wealth, it's hard to measure true value over different eras. The guest house being bigger sounds like a nice retreat, though!", "Wow, didn't know the guest house was that big!

Lol\nI love carbohydrates, so that makes dieting hard. I should try counting calories, but I'm not sure how many I would need.\nThe hardest part of a low carb diet is giving up sugar, bread and pasta. I don't mind eating the meat, poultry eggs, cheese and nuts however. It's just a lifestyle change but I lost 40 lbs.\nWay to go! Bread is my obstacle. I also like meats, eggs, and cheese. Maybe the ketogenic diet of restricting carbs would be a good diet.\nThe amount of carbohydrates varies with each type of low carb diet. I'm sure you will find one that you can live with!

I guess there were some rich Europeans too!\nI would love to be rich and will never experience it so tell me all you know about it\nThe definition of wealth is a normative process... So the pursuit of maximal wealth is seen as a conscious decision.\nHow much does one have to have to be considered wealthy?\nIt's hard to say. Wealth is relative to wherever you are living. It can also include things like natural capital, land, energy resources and minerals!", "candidates": ["That's intriguing! Even without a set number, do you feel wealthy within your community, or is it more about personal fulfillment?", "Wow! So wealth isn't just money but resources too. What's the most valuable non-monetary asset you own?", "True wealth seems complex. Have you ever thought about using your resources to help others or invest in sustainable projects?", "I wonder how the sense of being wealthy affects a person's happiness. Do you feel that your wealth has brought you joy?"]}
{"context": "Cake\nI used to hate chocolate cake, but now I think it's more the chocolate icing I didn't like. It's too rich.\nYes I agree! I can only have maybe 1 or 2 bites but that's it. Do you like cheesecake at all?\nI do, but afraid to try\nI feel the exact same! The icing is normally too rich and sweet for me.\nYep, mine is that I add weight whenever I indulge in it. I guess I don't know how to go easy whenever I'm having one\nAm sorry about that\nNo, it's okay. I just wish I have the metabolism to burn it off quickly like some do", "candidates": ["Maybe we could find a lighter recipe or an alternative sweet treat that's not so calorie-dense?", "Have you ever tried portion control or finding a workout you enjoy to help balance it out?", "Yeah, metabolism plays a huge role. Have you considered talking to a nutritionist for advice?", "I hear you, it's tough. What about non-traditional cheesecakes with less sugar, or using natural sweeteners?"]}
{"context": "Hello! How are you tonight?\nHi, I am doing great. Do you want to chat about drama, television, or comedy? It's your choice.\nI love choices! Let's talk about comedy!", "candidates": ["Awesome! Who's your favorite comedian right now?", "Great! Have you seen any good stand-up specials recently?", "Comedy it is! Do you prefer classic sitcoms or modern humor in shows?", "Oh, I love a good laugh too! What's the funniest movie you've watched lately?"]}

I enjoy being on my own right now. No one home but me.\nI lift weights in my spare time. What is your favorite food?\nPizza margherita with thin crust. Whats yours?\nThat pizza sounds real good. I hate sweet potatoes.\nBut they're good for you. Ever have sweet tater fries?\nI run in my spare time, marathon winner. Do you run?\nNo. I had foot surgery can barely walk. I'm rooting for you though.", "candidates": ["I'm sorry to hear about your foot surgery. Recovery must be tough, but I'm glad you're still in good spirits. Do you have other hobbies you enjoy since you're spending more time indoors?", "That sounds difficult with your foot. I admire your positivity, though! Maybe we could find a seated sport to enjoy together? Ever tried archery or fishing?", "Oh no, foot surgery sounds painful! How do you keep yourself entertained while recovering? Also, if you need any help getting around, just let me know, happy to assist.", "Recovery can be challenging \u2013 I hope you're healing well. While you're recovering, maybe we can watch a marathon together sometime or find some other activities that don't strain your foot?"]}
{"context": "Welp.. I am a little nervous about going back to school this year.\nWhat are you going to school for? Online or in person?\nI am a teacher.. In person.. Starting at a new school.. An alternative school.", "candidates": ["That's exciting but definitely a big change! What subject(s) will you be teaching at the alternative school?", "Oh wow, a new environment can be daunting. What's different about this alternative school compared to where you've taught before?", "Understandable to feel that way. What drew you to teaching at an alternative school?", "Starting fresh can be nerve-wracking. Do you have any strategies for your first day to help you settle in?"]}
{"context": "Do you play any athletic sports? I enjoy frisbee golf and soccer!\nYes! I trained for many years developing my skills as a competitive tennis player.\nThat's very interesting. I watched the French Open finals. Nadal is such an amazing athlete!\nYes! I love RAFA, \"The King of Clay\" and I believe he is one of the greatest ever!\nWhat surface is your favorite to play on and why?\nI always preferred hard courts as I was a pretty aggressive player with a lot of top spin.\nI see! It is interesting to me the different strategies of the different surfaces.", "candidates": ["Absolutely, each surface dictates a different style of play. On clay, you rely on endurance and strategy, while grass rewards serve-and-volley players with its fast pace. It's all about adapting your game plan.", "Definitely, strategy varies a lot. On grass, points are usually shorter; you have to be very sharp with your serve and returns. On clay, it's more of a mental game, playing out long rallies and grinding down your opponent.", "That's the beauty of tennis; it's like a chess match on different terrains. Clay courts can be grueling with slow balls, whereas indoor carpet suits players who like quick points and fast serves.", "Yes, and that variety keeps tennis exciting. I always enjoyed the consistency hard courts offer for my topspin-heavy game, but playing on grass or clay can be a refreshing challenge that tests different aspects of your skills."]}
{"context": "Purple\nI love purple. Liike the song purple rain is really good by Prince.\nI wonder if he has a song where he talks about the fusing of red and blue to make purple, literally?\nHaha I really don't think so. His songs are lovely anyway\nAre you a fan of prince? Purple rain... Purple rain...\nWell yes I am, he was such an amazing singer. Do you like music?\nI love music, mostly I only listen to Cindy Lauper.\nThat is an amazing singer too.

It lets me move around and experience new neighborhoods."]}
{"context": "Have you ever played any sports?\nI used to play baseball. Can you believe the Cubs almost won the last World Series? They were the first team to win back-to-back series, but hasn't won since!\nI played baseball as a kid too! I was kind of rooting for the Cubs last World Series. They came so close!\nI know! Did you know that if a player catches a baseball in their hat, they receive three extra bases?\nI'm surprised I don't see more players trying that. Some of the field players pull pretty incredible stunts to catch baseballs.", "candidates": ["Actually, it's a bit of a myth. Catching the ball in the cap is considered a trick play and isn't allowed. The batter would be awarded bases because of it!", "Yeah, the stunts are awesome, but using a hat is considered unsportsmanlike conduct. It's more about skill and respecting the game's rules.", "Haha, it's interesting, but that's against the rules! A catch with a hat is illegal, and the other team would benefit from the extra bases.", "Players focus on skill, not tricks. Plus, the rules penalize for catching with equipment not meant for it, so it's a no-go."]}

{"context": "I was so mad when I failed my science test. I knew I should have done better\nIt happens even when we study hard sometimes!\nI know, at least I learned from it", "candidates": ["Absolutely, the important thing is to extract lessons from it. Need help studying for the next one?", "Yeah, reflecting on the experience is key. Maybe next time trying a different study technique could help.", "That's a great attitude. What do you think you'll do differently next time?", "Learning from it is a win then. Maybe studying in a group could give you a boost for the next test?"]}

Ever think about getting your own boat for more adventures?", "That's great! Having a pontoon must make for some relaxing fishing trips. Any plans to go out on the lake soon?", "Lucky you!

Have you tried any fishing techniques from it, like trolling or still fishing?"]}

Do you like any of those?\nI like salmon and crab, never had fish steaks. Don't eat pork anymore lol\nI'm allergic to seafood, fish is the only thing safe to eat for me. So it's pretty much steak and pork for me.\nMy daughter is too. I have to be up at 4am every day but I was up half the night watching scary movies lol\nWhat movie? I can't watch scary movies anymore since having kids, they are too realistic now haha\nYeah they've started getting better. I was watching Hereditary which is AWESOME! Highly recommend.\nI'll have to see that then, thanks for the recommend.", "candidates": ["No problem! If you're brave enough for Hereditary, have a look at The Witch or Midsommar next. Same director, equally chilling.", "Just a heads-up, Hereditary is pretty intense. You might want to watch it when the kids aren't around!", "Definitely let me know what you think if you watch it. It's not for everyone, but it's a masterpiece in horror.", "If horror isn't really your thing anymore, we could swap recommendations for other genres! Ever seen any good comedies or dramas lately?"]}

It's also on the military reading lists.\nSpeaking of the military, did you know McDonalds invented the drive thru for people in the military back in the day\nI didn't know that. Why did they invent the drive thrus for the military?\nBack in the day if you were in uniform, you couldn't leave you car with it on. So hence the drive thru allowed them to get food", "candidates": ["That's fascinating! It makes sense for convenience, but it's incredible how one military rule influenced such a massive shift in the fast-food industry.", "Wow, I had no idea. That's quite a neat piece of trivia about McDonald's. I'm guessing drive-thrus ended up being popular with everyone else too, huh?", "Really? That's a smart adaptation for service members. It's amazing to think about how military needs can lead to widespread changes in society.", "Huh, that's an interesting piece of history. It's cool to see how the needs of the military can spur innovation even in something as everyday as getting a burger."]}
{"context": "Good afternoon! How are you?\nI'm ever so bored of these simpletons. You?", "candidates": ["Oh, that's unfortunate. I'm doing well, thanks! Have you considered finding a new hobby or interest to mix things up a bit?", "I'm sorry to hear that, I've been pretty engaged with work myself. Anything in particular causing your boredom?", "Well, the day's going smoothly for me. Maybe we could plan an activity to help you shake off that boredom?", "That's rough.

He brings a lot of depth to the role, and it's a fresh take away from his comedic persona.", "Krasinski manages to show off his dramatic chops in Jack Ryan. If you liked him in The Office, you might enjoy seeing a different side of his talent.", "Yes, Krasinski's transition from comedy to drama shows his versatility.

It's a shame they stopped it; it would have shown a different side of the games.", "Artistic categories in the Olympics sound really interesting.

There must be a balance between rights and public safety.", "Even if the military finds them useful, I worry about the same technology trickling down to civilians. It's a fine line between defense and excess.", "True, the military context is different.

About the 3-team soccer, it's more of an experimental game. I think it emphasizes cooperation and strategy in a unique way.", "That's a fun fact about Jon Stewart. Didn't see that coming. Three-team soccer must be pretty chaotic, but it's all about promoting a different kind of thinking within the game.", "Jon Stewart, playing for the U.S.? Quite unexpected.

The red and blue colors seem so ingrained now it's hard to imagine a time without them.", "Yeah, it's strange to think about! If there were more parties, I wonder how they would choose their colors.", "Memory is weird like that.

What's the longest trip you've taken within Pennsylvania?", "$60 is pricey for sure, though I've heard Pennsylvania has some scenic routes.

The earliest work of Drammatic theory was that of Aristotle's poetics back in 335 BC!\nJim Carrey doesnt do dramas\nI think that was a good thing because he is so much better at comedies. I think it's cool he only wanted the movies that project positivity.\nDo you enjoy football?", "candidates": ["Sure, I do enjoy football!

It's vital to seek out unbiased news to form our own perspectives, don't you think?", "Wow, that's high. Guess it shows we need to be critical of where we get our news from.", "No wonder it's hard to find the truth sometimes. Do you try to balance your sources to get a clearer picture?", "Opinion does drive ratings. But it makes you wonder about the state of journalistic integrity, right?"]}

I thought someone was trying to break in.\nOh goodness, what was it?\nNot exactly sure but I think it was a tree branch rubbing up against the window", "candidates": ["Wow, that does sound frightening, but I'm relieved it was just a tree. Maybe you should trim the branches to prevent it from happening again?", "That's creepy! Are you going to check it out in the morning or let it be?", "I'm glad it turned out to be nothing serious. Have you had problems with that sort of thing before?", "Trees can make the strangest sounds. You might want to get some curtains that block the noise a bit."]}

It was actually created by a marine biologist.\nWow, really. I figured some dummy from Hollywood came up with it. Do you know the starfish's name on the show? It's my favorite charter.\nI know, it really doesn't seem like a brainiac made it. Hahaha. The starfish is Patrick Star. He is so funny.\nYea that's him. It seems like this show has been for ever.\nIt has been around forever, but I suppose Nickelodeon would be reluctant to get rid of a show that has made them $13 Billion dollars in merchandising revenue!!!!!\nWow that's insane. My kid is to little to want the clothing yet. I have be in trouble.\nYeah kids get so caught up in the newest shows. I know mine like to have the toys from new shows.

It'll be a nice change of weather from the cold of New York.\nThat will be a pleasant change, I've been a lot of time in Pensacola, Florida. I've never been to the Keys.\nIs it nice in Pensacola? This will be my first time in Florida, so I'm looking forward to visiting somewhere new.\nYes, especially the beaches. The sand is white & soft, and emerald colored water. Do you have any activities planned?\nThat sounds so pretty, especially the water! Yes, one of the first things I'm going to do is snorkling. Hope to see lots of sea-life.\nThat will be fun and exciting! I hear it is a great place to snorkel and maybe you'll get lucky and see a sea turtle!\nYes, that would be cool to see!

Was it any good compared to Facebook?", "MySpace was before my time, I've always been more into Facebook and Instagram.", "Sure did, but that feels like a lifetime ago. It was quite different, wasn't it?", "I remember MySpace! It was all about customizing your profile and that top friends list."]}

I guess they get used to having all that endorsement money and forget to budget carefully...", "candidates": ["It's true, many athletes don't manage their finances well. It's sad seeing them struggle after retirement despite earning so much during their careers.", "That's a problem across professional sports\u2014poor financial planning can really take a toll. They should teach money management in the rookie symposiums.", "Yeah, it's pretty ironic. They're like shooting stars\u2014shine bright, then fade out fast financially.

The EPA ranks the Prius among the cleanest vehicles sold in the US based on emissions!\nThank makes sense, it seems very eco friendly, on us and the world", "candidates": ["Absolutely! If you're looking at efficiency and eco-friendliness, a Prius is great. Plus, Toyotas are known for their reliability, which is a huge plus for any car owner.", "Besides their green credentials, Toyotas also have a strong resale value. So, if you ever decide to sell, you'll likely get a good portion of your investment back.", "That's true! Have you considered their other hybrids? They offer a range of models now, so you've got options depending on your space and design preferences.", "You're right about the mpg and emissions.

{"context": "Do you follow current politics in Washington DC?\nYes I follow it from time to time. I also know that the president of Indonesia made three pop albums, maybe Trump will do the same haha\nSome times I find it entertaining but mostly I find it immature and distaining. I am not sure about Trump singing though. I recently read that the 3 richest presidents were Kennedy, Washington, and Jefferson. Do you think that is still true?\nI don't know. You would think that Trump would be on that list but I guess he's not? I do know that Washington and Jefferson had slaves and so that probably helped with their overall net worth\nI suppose it would have to do with the time value of money, like inflation over 2+ centuries. Have you ever had an opportunity to take the White House tour?\nI did but it was a long time ago. Apparently the guest house is bigger than the White House itself, do you think that is true\nI too toured it, a long time ago before 9/11. So, I suspect the tour has changed for security reasons. About the guest house, I could easily see it being bigger. After all, visiting dignitaries have to also be able to house their staff and security personnel during the visit. While Secret Service protects the President while he is in the White House, the do not have to live with him.", "candidates": ["True, inflation does skew those figures. It's fascinating to think how wealth is measured through history. By the way, have you read any recent articles on presidential history or wealth?", "That's a good point about the time value of money. Regarding the White House tour, it's probably more restricted now. Did you visit any particular room that stood out to you?", "Yeah, adjusting for inflation is tricky. Also, did you know the guest house you mentioned is called the Blair House? It's quite historic and indeed quite large.", "I wonder how current presidents' wealth will be viewed in the future. It's incredible to walk through the same rooms past presidents did, right? The history in that place is palpable."]}

I think I enjoy all of the primary colors equally.\nI like yellow and black together\nBlack is kind of confusing as a color since it's actually just the absence of color.\nYea, same with white", "candidates": ["That's true, but in art, black and white are often used as colors which provide stark contrasts and can make designs really pop!", "Yes, scientifically speaking! In terms of pigment, though, black actually contains all colors, while white reflects them.", "Absolutely, yet in design, they are both used effectively to highlight other colors and create visual impact.", "Right, in light, white's all colors together and black's none.

{"context": "Hello. Do you prefer either republican or democrats when voting?\nHello. I would rather not answer that. Are you comfortable answering such a question?\nWell I'm still deciding. Currently I am more republican of the two simply based on the party's ideals and side on hot issues, but I wouldn't say I am a fervant republican. I often care more about the candidates than party, but the last elections candidates weren't favorable\nInteresting. So you favor the Republicans on issues, but don't care for most of the candidates? Did you vote in the 2018 midterms?\nI could not since I was out of the country at the time. I wonder if we will ever get a president from an unaffiliated 3rd party who isn't republican or democrat? We still haven't\nI think it's unlikely. There hasn't been one in over 100 years. And the government is set up to be a two-party system. Do you think having lots of viable parties would be better?\nNot really, but as I said I care more about the candidate. If memory serves, I think I learn that Roosevelt came remarkably close\nI have an idea, I think billionaires shouldn't be allowed to run for president. JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents, and he was only a millionaire. What do you think?\nWell this might be a digression, but according to plato, the most idealistic of rulers/presidents would be philosopher kinds who have the mental capacity, wisdom, and experience, but wouldn't have worldly affiliations or possessions to influence his judgement.\nNot a digression at all! I think big money is what has destroyed politicians today. It is what's allowed all three branches of government to be Republicn right now. I wonder if there should be safeguards against THAT!?", "candidates": ["Absolutely, implementing campaign finance reforms could be a step towards reducing the influence of wealth in politics.", "Safeguards seem necessary, maybe like capping campaign contributions to level the playing field.", "Possibly, but wouldn't the wealthy just find other ways to exert their influence? It's tricky.", "Philosophically, it sounds good, but practically, we need concrete laws to prevent money from dominating politics."]}

Maybe it could help her realize the importance of caring for her kids.", "I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties. It's unfair how these things work sometimes. How are her children doing now?", "That sounds incredibly frustrating.

What areas of science most interest you and your family?", "True, but I love intertwining personal experiences into games. It makes them relatable. So, does your family working in science influence your hobbies or career choices?", "I get that. Perhaps a collaboration is in order? You could advise on scientific details for a future game \u2013 infuse it with real knowledge, you know?", "It's quite refreshing to meet someone passionate about their interests.

The slow decline of cancer doesn't have the sudden shock of something unexpected but is draining.\nOh no I totally understand! Cancer is the worst!

Home-making requires endless patience and multitasking. How did your dad react to the missing piece of cake?"]}
{"context": "Hi, what is your favorite album of all time? And favorite format? Do you still play LPs?\nThat's a tough call because I love so many styles of music. I literally love it all! I\nOkay then what comes to mind? I still love playing vinyl but I hate that cassettes are starting to come back. Their sound quality is inferior and we no longer need them as a portable format.\nI guess I would say I have a soft spot for 80s pop and hard rock music because I grew up in those years and graduated high school in 1989.\nThat's cool. I like 80s & 90's music a lot, but I like some newer stuff too, like Linkin Park. Hybrid theory is the best selling album of the 21st century. Too bad there will never be another Linkin Park album.\nI liked them as well. Led Zeppelin decided not to title their 4th album in order to confuse the hated rock press.\nAnd now IV is iconic. I am sick of getting albums on MP3 though, that's how everyone wants them but the compressed sound is just not as warm as vinyl or even cd which also isn't that great.\nI agree with you there 100 percent! They sound holllow and thin to me. I love hearing the needle on vinyl.\nI have some old 78rpm records I can't even play anymore since today's record players won't play them. It is really interesting how buying music has really changed these days. Even for physical music most of the time you have to buy it online.\nI agree there. I used to love going to record stores when I was younger. Now there are only 2 independant record stores left within driving distance of where I live and I have to drive 1 1/2 hours either South or West to get to them. My dream job in a perfect world would have been to own a record store.", "candidates": ["That dream can still be alive! Maybe consider an online store with a personal touch, like hand-written notes or curated playlists for buyers?", "Owning a record store sounds amazing! Have you thought about maybe starting a pop-up shop at local events or markets?", "There's a romance to record stores that's hard to replace. Ever consider organizing a community vinyl swap to recapture some of that feeling?", "It's tough, isn't it? The convenience of digital has a cost. But with vinyl sales increasing, who knows, maybe there's a revival on the horizon for stores like your dream!"]}

Where ya from?\nPennsylvania. I've a sustainable farm here.\nFrom tennessee here. Also have a farm.\nWhat animals do you have. I have pigs, horses and hens.", "candidates": ["Nice! We have cattle and goats. Always wanted hens. Do they require a lot of care?", "Oh, that's cool. Just crops on our land. How do you manage the sustainability aspect?", "Horses, huh? Admirable. We focus on veggies and fruits, no animals yet. Maybe someday.", "Lovely. Our farm has bees and sheep. Ever think of expanding to more animals?"]}
{"context": "I am so happy that I get to see Foreigner in concert next month.\nThat's good. It means you will be on vacation and having fun\nNo, just going to see them after work one night.", "candidates": ["Oh, nice! So it's a local gig then? Must be nice to not have to travel far for the concert.", "That sounds convenient! How often do you get to enjoy concerts on a work night?", "Cool! It's great you can unwind with some live music right after work.", "Awesome! I bet it\u2019ll be refreshing to rock out after a day at the office."]}

Festivals today still try to capture that spirit of peace and music.", "There are similar festivals, but it's hard to replicate the magic of Woodstock. It was a unique time in history.", "A modern-day Woodstock would be epic! With today's tech and social media, it'd be a global phenomenon.", "They've had anniversary events, but nothing has quite matched the original. Maybe for the 60th anniversary?"]}

I've just got back from the store....it was an interesting trip\nWhat happened?\nWell I ended up getting almost all of my groceries for free....", "candidates": ["Free groceries? Sounds like your shopping trip was more eventful than usual. Did you win some sort of contest?", "Almost free? How did you manage that? Tell me your secrets!", "That's incredible!

{"context": "Hello there, do you enjoy comedy movies or tv shows?\nYes, I do. Have you seen the Incredibles or the sequel?\nNo, I haven't but I have heard some interesting things about it, how about you?\nHaven't seen it myself. The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. It's a fun period for clothing and architecture.\nYeah I think that is cool they did a throwback animation film.\nWhen making the Incredibles, director Brad Bird intentionally used artists who were likely to either quit or be fired from Pixar; because he believed only they could create everything that he needed. I wonder why he thought that.\nThat is very interesting, it sounds like he knew exactly what he wanted to get for his movie.\nEdna Mode, the superhero costume designer in The Incredibles, is voiced by Brad Bird, the film's director. I guess he did more than just direct.\nThey most likely saved a lot of money not having to pay another top name actor as well.\nLOL. Very true. Bird voiced Edna during storyboarding sessions, after which the production team couldn't find an actress who could do the voice better than him. I guess he had one voice in him.", "candidates": ["Bird accidentally casting himself sounds a bit like Mike Myers voicing Shrek after Chris Farley's death. Serendipity plays a big role in filmmaking, huh?", "Talk about a hidden talent! Did Bird have any experience in voice acting, or was Edna Mode his debut?", "It's great when directors can fill unexpected roles. Do you think Edna\u2019s character added a special touch because Bird himself voiced her?", "Now whenever I watch it, I'm going to listen extra closely to Edna. Directors doing voice work seems rare, are there other examples of that?"]}

{"context": "You know... It slightly offends me when someone calls me a slacker, I do not feel I habitually avoid work. I do not feel I slack in work ethic. Or do I? Dundundah\nOh man that irks me too! People seem to think I can be a slacker because I prefer work that involves mental energy over work that involves physical energy!\nExactly! I feel better then. I know they attempt to track down such evaders (they call it) and call it slacker raids? I would want one of those ha! A slacker rave maybe\nWhat on earth, I have never heard of such a thing!\nI (BLEEP) you not. In World War I the word slacker was commonly used to describe someone who was not participating in war effort\nWell (BLEEP), then everyone was slackers!! I would be hiding in my cellar or whatever they had back then. LOL", "candidates": ["Haha, I can picture you as a cellar dweller! But that's the thing, not wanting to be cannon fodder doesn't make one a slacker, just sane!", "LOL, exactly! It's about survival, not slacking. Anyone with a brain would be finding that cellar!", "Right?! Hiding seems like the smart option. Self-preservation over slacking any day of the week.", "I'm with you! Sometimes, avoiding danger is the wisest work there is. Plus, cellars probably had some good wine to wait it out with!"]}

I often root for teams that are not favored. I like to see upsets.\nMe too, I am always rooting for the underdog. This year the Green Bay Packers were the underdog\nI wish they had won. I think that the team that won the super bowl has won too many times.\nFor sure, Patriots need to be stopped, and I think they need to stop cheating. Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers are great quarterbacks though", "candidates": ["Yeah, Brady's skill is undeniable, but I'd love to see more parity in the league. It gets predictable with one team dominating.", "Agreed. Rodgers is remarkable, too. It's about time the league sees a new champion though.", "Maybe the league should consider a salary cap adjustment? Could help with the balance.", "The Patriots' dynasty is impressive, but I'm all for giving other teams a shot at glory. It keeps the game exciting!"]}
