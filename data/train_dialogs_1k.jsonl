By the way, does your fishing work influence your views on climate change at all?", "Thanks for the tip! Are hurricanes affecting the fishing industry there much?", "Outer Banks, here I come! Is there any local seafood dish that I should absolutely try?", "That's really interesting. Have you always lived and fished in Cape Hatteras, or did you move there for work?", "I'm curious, as a fisherman, do you notice any differences in fish behavior or patterns due to environmental changes?", "I've heard the sunrises there are stunning. Might you know a good spot for a peaceful morning view?", "Outer Banks sounds perfect. Is it also family-friendly or more suited for solo travelers and couples?"]}
{"context": "Did you know women can also play if they make the cut?\nI do! I would like to see the chips from their shoulder pads that record their movement. I bet results would be different in women.\nI am sure they are different even from player to player. Do you know how long a game lasts in terms of playtime?\nNot very long. About 11 minutes. Crazy to get paid as much as they do for such little play. However, engineers make more money.\nI know, right? And we are glued to the TV for so long when you think about it.\nThe cheerleaders for the Saints can't eat in the same restaurants as the players. They keep them separated.\nI wonder why that is, and they even have to leave in the middle of their meal if the players walk in.", "candidates": ["Maybe it's to avoid potential fraternization that could lead to distractions or scandals?", "That sounds like a power move, keeping the team's focus strictly on the sport.", "It's quite possible they're enforcing outdated notions of professionalism and boundaries.", "That rule could be a way to maintain a strict image and protect the brand.", "It may be about creating a sense of elitism and hierarchy within the organization.", "Sounds like an extreme measure for avoiding conflicts of interest or favoritism.", "I've heard it's to prevent relationships that could complicate team dynamics or lead to accusations of impropriety.", "It seems like a control tactic, perhaps to manage public perception of the team.", "Could it be for legal reasons, like to sidestep potential harassment issues?", "It might just be an old tradition that's continued without much thought to how it's perceived now."]}

All positive all the time isn't something to aim for.\nDrama can have positive outcomes, and comedy often comes at the expense of others.\nCountry music sometimes comes at the expense of others. There are only 2 African Americans in the country music Hall of Fame.\nCountry certainly hasn't been the genre for African Americans. I would guess it's as asymmetrical as rap and R&B for white people.", "candidates": ["You're right. It reflects the broader cultural divides.

Maybe we'll see more diversity in country as audiences change.", "Well, hip-hop had Eminem. Maybe country's Eminem is just around the corner, opening doors.", "Music has always been an expression of culture, and yeah, some genres are still catching up on inclusivity.", "Times are changing though. Rap and R&B have become universal, so maybe country isn't far behind.", "Asymmetry in music genres shows deeper societal issues, don't you think? It's all about representation.", "Yet, the few cross-genre collaborations we've seen suggest people are ready for a blend, don't you agree?", "It's all about exposure and opportunity. The music industry could do with less pigeonholing based on race.", "I wonder if it's a question of gatekeepers or audiences? Who's really driving these disparities?", "Some barriers are invisible and cultural. It takes pioneers to break them, and time for others to follow."]}

Birds like the lyrebird evolve to mimic their surroundings, even if that includes man-made sounds.", "Haha, I know, it's like nature's own soundboard. Some birds can even replicate camera shutters and car engines!", "They're the ultimate copycats!

Wealth across eras is hard to compare, but it's safe to say that real estate and inheritance played key roles for Washington and Jefferson. Modern-wise, Trump is likely the wealthiest.", "I'm not sure, but I believe George Washington was quite wealthy for his time. Combine land, slaves, and inflation\u2014he might top the list, followed closely by modern magnates like Trump.", "Hmm, I think it's tricky with inflation, but historically, George Washington was huge on landowning. Jefferson had Monticello. In the recent era, Trump's fortune is quite notable.", "I know that presidential wealth varies greatly, and inheritance, like with Kennedy, and self-made fortunes like Trump's, both tilt the scale. Washington's vast estates probably put him high on that list, too.", "If we're counting inflation-adjusted assets, George Washington might lead due to his landholdings. JFK's family wealth is well-known, and Trump's business dealings have surely placed him in the conversation."]}

{"context": "Good morning! Have you been to any concerts lately?\nNo, in fact, I don't quite remember my last concert. Like the Ramones, who probably don't remember their first concerts, they have been touring for 20 years.\nOh wow, that's been a while. They've played over 2,263 concerts.\nIt must be horrible for family life, but I don't think family life is in the values of the Ramones.", "candidates": ["True, the Ramones were all about that rock and roll lifestyle. Heard any good new bands that give off that same energy?", "Definitely a tough balance. So, what kind of music are you into these days?", "Yeah, music often comes with sacrifices. Have you seen any recent virtual concerts?", "I wonder how artists today manage tour life and family. Have you noticed any changes in the scene?", "That's quite the commitment to rock. Do you think the scene still has bands with that level of dedication?", "I can't even imagine! Is there a band or artist you'd like to see as much as the Ramones toured?", "It\u2019s interesting how some prioritize their careers over family. Have you seen any changes in band dynamics over the years because of this?", "Touring can indeed be grueling. What's the most you've seen from a band in terms of dedication to touring?", "The Ramones were relentless! Does family life play a bigger role in the lives of today\u2019s musicians, do you think?", "Must have been quite the experience for them. Ever thought about what life on the road for that long would be like?"]}
{"context": "Greetings! Are you a Netflix user by any chance? I just learned that Netflix accounts for a third of all internet bandwidth between 9 p.m. and midnight. That's a lot of people streaming movies and shows!\nAin't much on TV these days. Folks want quality entertainment. YouTube also sucks up tons of bandwidth.\nThat's true\u2014about YouTube. But I've been amazed by the growth of Netflix. There's almost no country it's not in, the exceptions being places like China and North Korea.\nThe Chinese government doesn't want imperial influence within its borders.\nSo, you said folks want quality entertainment. Do you mean drama? It's one of the oldest forms of fiction, dating back to the time of Aristotle.\nDrama is great. But do actors choose drama because they like drama, or because they like the actors? Michael Caine had ulterior motives.", "candidates": ["Michael Caine is a legend! His reasons probably evolved over his career. Do you have a favorite role of his?", "Interesting point. I guess for some, the allure of working with esteemed colleagues adds to the appeal of drama.", "Haha, ulterior motives, you say? Sometimes it's the script or director, but a great cast can be a strong draw too.", "You've got me curious about Caine's motives now! It certainly adds another layer to watching his performances.", "That's an intriguing perspective. Would you say this affects the authenticity of their performances in dramas?", "Do you think that's true for most actors in drama, or is Michael Caine a special case in your opinion?", "It's a chicken-and-egg situation, maybe? Actors drawn to drama because of prestige, perhaps coupled with a passion for the craft?", "I wonder if it's a bit of both. The art of drama and the company you keep could be equally influential.", "Artistic ambition or the chance to work with other greats, actors have various incentives. Makes you appreciate their work more!", "That's a complex question. Could be for the artistry of drama or maybe the chance to work with idols influences their choices."]}
{"context": "Did you know some actors make in excess of $700,000?\nI heard that Hugh Laurie made $700,000 per episode of the TV show House. He was the highest paid at the time, but I am sure people get paid more now... inflation.", "candidates": ["Wow, $700,000 per episode is incredible! Do you think that's justified for actors, given the show's success?", "That's massive! Has any actor surpassed Hugh Laurie since then?", "Clearly, the pay scales can be astronomical. What about actresses, do they earn as much?", "That's amazing! But is it common for most TV actors, or is that just top-tier celebrities?", "Whoa, do you think those high earnings are a reflection of their talent or just the show's popularity?", "I had no idea TV salaries were that high! Inflation aside, do you reckon streaming has influenced actor wages?", "Jeez, so if that was then, I wonder what someone like The Rock earns for his TV appearances now!", "That's pretty wild, isn't it? But are these figures public knowledge, or are they kept under wraps?", "If inflation bumps those numbers up, what does that say about the gap between stars and regular workers in the industry?", "Huh, if Hugh Laurie made that much back then, it must put immense pressure on shows' budgets today, right?"]}

The club's history and success are just too enticing.", "That\u2019s fair enough. For me, it's all about Bayern Munich's dominance in Germany. Truly impressive.", "Soccer's not for everyone. But as for me? I bleed the blue of Chelsea.", "Even casually, it's fun, right? Anyway, I support PSG. Their recent rise has been exciting.", "I respect that - sometimes it's more relaxing not to pledge allegiance. But I'm an Ajax fan through and through."]}

From what I hear, Anki wants his robots to be able to hold their own with people.\nI think it would be a great service for people. I heard they are the best-selling toy company on Amazon.\nThey've got a new product called Vector. It is like Alexa, and their goal is to have one in every home.\nOh, so they are working with Amazon now? Jeff Bezos is a great CEO; he would be of great contribution to the project.\nI'm not sure if they are working together or competing. They are using Alexa as an example for what they want their Vector to be. They say there is one big difference between the two, though. Their Vector has a personality.", "candidates": ["Fascinating! A robot with a personality could change how we interact with technology at home.", "A personality, huh? That\u2019s an edge. Makes the tech feel more like a companion than a tool.", "That's really innovative \u2013 a robot with character could be more engaging for kids and adults alike.", "I wonder what kind of personality Vector has. Will it be more like a friend than a gadget?", "Interesting concept. I'm curious how they'll balance the robot's personality with functionality.", "That's quite ambitious. Giving a robot a personality might make it more relatable to us.", "A personality could be a game-changer. It\u2019ll be exciting to see how it evolves over time.", "Adding personality sounds tricky. Do you think it\u2019ll help them compete with more established products like Alexa?", "This opens up so many possibilities! Imagine robots with different personalities for different user preferences.", "A personalized robot sounds appealing, but I wonder how they'll ensure it appeals to a broad audience."]}

Anyway, could you tell me more about your mom's work opportunity?", " I do not, but I'm adaptable with technology. Could we go back to the potential job your mom has?"]}
{"context": "Do you watch TV?\nI do. I love The Simpsons. Fox actually considered making a cable channel of just that show!\nBut they also threatened to sue The Simpsons so that The Simpsons wouldn't parody its anti-democratic party agenda. I guess it's a love-hate relationship.\nThat is funny. Fox News was created by a Republican media strategist and Nixon, so that's probably not a surprise.\nIt's super popular too, watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.\nYeah, that is pretty nuts. I just got a call on my phone. It's crazy we can call overseas and the cables to get there are only 2.7 inches in diameter!", "candidates": ["Wow, that's some advanced technology. Who would have thought so much data could pass through such a small cable?", "The power of fiber optics, huh? It's amazing how they've revolutionized communication worldwide.", "I heard those undersea cables are also vulnerable to shark bites! Have you seen the videos?", "It's pretty mind-blowing. We're connected in ways we never could have imagined a century ago.", "Only 2.7 inches? That's smaller than a donut! Goes to show you can't judge a cable by its cover.", "Modern engineering is incredible. To think, something so narrow connects us to the entire world.", "Yeah, and I read that those cables are also responsible for the internet. We'd be lost without them!", "Isn't it wild? I once saw a documentary on how they lay those cables across the ocean floor.", "Makes you appreciate the complexity of our global communications network. It's a technical marvel!", "So, a cable not much thicker than a clipboard holds the line to international dialogue. Amazing, right?"]}

Did you call the police?\nI did, but no one saw who did it.", "candidates": ["Are there any surveillance cameras around that might have caught it on tape?", "That's unfortunate. Did the police offer any help with the insurance claim process?", "What a headache. Did you notice any damage to the surrounding cars that might give a clue?", "That's so frustrating. Are there any witnesses you could find later that might come forward?", "Ugh, that's the worst. How bad was the damage to your car?", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you spoken to the store to see if they have any information?", "That's rough. Could the police at least file a hit-and-run report?", "What a day you've had. Is there anything I can do to help?", "That sucks. Is your insurance going to be able to cover the repairs without knowing who did it?", "Wow, I'm really sorry.

It's wonderful\u2014do you think she'll be chatty like her mom or dad?", "Yikes, that sounded wrong. I think it's fantastic! What was her first word?", "My bad, I meant it's terribly cute!

Georgia, you say! I wonder if the Baptist practices differ much between states.", "I didn't know that. Has the Georgia origin influenced Southern Baptist beliefs in any specific ways?", "That\u2019s a neat piece of trivia. I\u2019ve always associated Southern Baptists closely with Florida, too.", "Oh, interesting! Do you think the church's origin has an effect on Southern Baptist culture today?", "Georgia, huh? I've always just thought of the 'Southern' part as a general regional indicator.", "Ah, Georgia is the birthplace, then? It's amazing to see how widespread the movement has become since then.", "No kidding? I had always assumed the 'Southern' part referred to the whole South.

I haven't really found a good strategy to avoid the nervousness, to be honest.\nI think it's very okay to be anxious and nervous. It's how we are made and built.

Right now, I tend to do some kind of neurotic things to control the nerves, like I am OCD about collecting little figurines.\nWell, if it helps you to control your nervousness.", "candidates": ["Yeah, collecting them gives me a sense of order. Maybe I should also try meditation or something calming before interviews.", "That's true. I've considered talking to a therapist about managing anxiety; it might be more effective.", "It's definitely a quirky coping mechanism. Perhaps I should also look into more conventional stress-relief techniques, like deep breathing exercises.", "I've heard exercise can help reduce stress. I might start going for runs the day before an interview.", "I might actually bring one of my figurines to my next interview, as a good luck charm and a calming focus point.", "That's just one way I cope, but I've been thinking about practicing mock interviews to build my confidence.", "I've found that having a routine before interviews, structured around my figurine collecting, somehow grounds me. What about you?", "Do you think professionally discussing interview strategies could help us? Maybe we could learn to channel the nervous energy.", "I joke about it, but it's actually a bit disruptive. I feel like I might benefit from learning some relaxation techniques.", "I wonder if I should use that focus on detail and apply it to preparing for interviews. Channeling my nervous energy into something productive."]}

It was way different than the movie!", "candidates": ["Definitely, the book dives much deeper into the characters' psyches, especially Jack's descent into madness.", "I agree, King's ability to build suspense is so much more intense in the novel than on screen.", "Yeah, Kubrick took some liberties with the adaptation, but both are great in their own way.", "True, the book has those creepy hedge animals that didn't make it into the movie. They were terrifying!", "You're right. The movie missed a lot of the nuances of the Overlook's haunting history that King included.", "That's often the case, isn't it? The book's detail can never fully translate to film.", "I know what you mean\u2014the inner turmoil of the characters in the book was something else.", "I felt the same way. The book's ending was so different from the movie's\u2014much more haunting.", "Absolutely, and the telepathic connection between Danny and Dick Hallorann is much more pronounced in the book.", "I always find it interesting how adaptations can change your perspective on a character, like Wendy."]}

I have not been there as of yet.  \nI haven't either. Have you traveled much?  \nI have. I would like to go to Europe and visit more.  \nHave you been to Europe before?

Jerry would seem to always be the aggressor, although if Tom were to have his way, Jerry would be his next meal. Really conflicting stuff.\nBut Tom had a pretty nice life with a home and plenty of food. He just really wanted to catch that mouse.\nWhich was his job as a cat. The mouse is an uninvited pest. We were forced to sympathize with a mouse thief. I wonder why?", "candidates": ["Maybe it's because Jerry outwitted Tom so often, showing that brains can outperform brawn.", "Cartoons often root for the underdog, and the clever mouse outsmarting the larger cat is a classic trope.", "It could be a metaphor for the little guy standing up against bigger adversaries in real life.", "Anthropomorphism plays a role.

Jerry never gives up, no matter how many times Tom tries to catch him.", "The creators might have wanted to flip the script; showing the prey outsmarting the predator is unexpected and entertaining.", "It's intriguing that in some episodes, Tom and Jerry work together, so the violence isn't one-sided or definitive.", "The show plays with morality; it's not about good or evil but the fun in their dynamic and the slapstick humor.", "It reflects the complexity of life, doesn't it?
